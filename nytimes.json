And because agriculture employs much of the labor force -- about 28 percent in Honduras alone, -- the livelihoods of millions of people are at stake.Last year, the bank that climate change could lead at least 1.4 million people to flee their homes in Mexico and Central America and migrate during the next three decades.The United States has allocated tens of millions of dollars in aid in recent years for farmers across Central America, including efforts to help them adapt to the changing climate.But President Trump has vowed to cut off all foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador because of what he calls their failure to curb the flow of migrants north.Critics contend the punishment is misguided, though, because it could undermine efforts to address the very problems that are driving people to abandon their farms and head to the United States.\"If Donald Trump withdraws all the funds for Honduras, it's going to generate more unemployment, and that's going to generate more migration,\" said Maria Esperanza Lopez, the general manager of Copranil, a coffee-growers cooperative here in western Honduras. \"And that's going to result in more abandoned farms.\"Coffee cultivators in the region are at particular risk of disruption because the crop is highly sensitive to weather variations.Fredi Onan Vicen Pena, the coffee farmer whose brothers, sister and teenage son have already given up and joined the exodus north, reached over and tore a leaf off one of his plants.It was a mottled yellow and brown: signs of coffee rust, a disease whose spread has been influenced by climate variability. As much as 70 percent of his crop, planted across five acres in a pine forest, had been affected, he estimated, and there was little chance he could salvage it.\"Climate change is destroying some farms,\" said Mr. Vicen, 41.Beyond that, some of his healthier plants had begun to blossom nearly two months ahead of schedule because of a heavy unseasonable downpour, throwing the entire growing cycle into doubt.\"This is not something we predicted,\" Mr. Vicen said.Average temperatures have risen by about two degrees Fahrenheit in Central America over the past several decades, making the cultivation of coffee difficult, if not untenable, at lower altitudes that were once suitable.That has forced some farmers to search for land at higher altitudes, switch to other crops, change professions -- or migrate.\"Some very fine families that have been producing quality coffee for a long time are now facing the decision of whether to stay in coffee,\" said Catherine M. Tucker, a professor of anthropology at the University of Florida who has done research in Honduras for more than two decades.Some climate scientists say that in the absence of long-term meteorological data, it is hard for them to say with certainty whether the increasing variability is caused by long-term changes in the region's climate. But, they say, they are leaning in that direction.\"It's becoming so unusual, it's almost certainly climate change,\" said Dr. Edwin J. Castellanos, dean of the Research Institute at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, a university in Guatemala City, and one of Central America's leading scientists in the field of climate change.Climate change is rarely the sole factor in the decision to migrate. Violence and poverty are prime drivers, but climate change can be a tipping point, farmers and experts say.\"Small farmers are already living in poverty; they're already at the threshold of not being able to survive,\" Mr. Castellanos said. \"So any changes in the situation may push them to have enough incentives to leave.\"The outlook for the region seems bleak. Reduced yields of coffee and subsistence crops like corn and beans could significantly increase food insecurity and malnutrition. By , the amount of land suitable for growing coffee in Central America could drop by more than 40 percent by 2050.The number of coffee producers in the area where Mr. Vicen lives has dropped by a quarter in the past decade -- to about 9,000 from about 12,000 -- partly because of pressure from climate change, said Marlon Danilo Mejia, the regional coordinator for the Honduran Coffee Institute, an industry trade group.A vast majority are small producers, managing less than about nine acres each, he said.Jose Edgardo Vicen, 37, one of Mr. Vicen's brothers, had weighed migrating for years. He had worked in the coffee fields since he was a boy, continuing the family tradition. In this part of Honduras, coffee is a major crop, with an increasing amount bound for North America, Europe and Asia.But after a rust outbreak and other pressures in recent years, including plunging commodity prices, the younger Mr. Vicen said he could no longer earn enough from his harvest to cover production costs.He headed north with his 14-year-old son last August, crossed the border illegally and settled in Texas. A brother and a sister, driven by similar circumstances, left Honduras soon afterward and also sneaked into the United States.\"For the small producer, I promise you, there's no way to get ahead,\" said Mr. Vicen, who now works in construction and sends remittances home to support his wife and daughter.When he was younger, harvest time \"was like a party,\" he recalled. Now, \"there are only losses, no profits.\"Fifteen producers from the Vicens' coffee cooperative -- more than 10 percent of its members -- have migrated to the United States in the past year, said Ms. Esperanza Lopez, the general manager of the cooperative. They have joined thousands of others from villages in Honduras's western highlands.Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, said that government statistics on apprehension of migrants at the southwest border of the United States in recent years reflect a sharp increase in people from western Honduras.After large caravans of migrants arrived last fall in Tijuana, Mexico, a United Nations found that 72 percent of those surveyed were from Honduras -- and 28 percent of the respondents had worked in the agricultural sector.The exodus of farm workers has worsened already serious labor shortages in western Honduras. Some industry leaders in the region joke that if the caravans in recent months were \"the laborer caravans,\" the next wave will be \"the grower caravans.\"Coffee farmers have been scrambling to adjust to the changes, learning which species are more resistant to plague and drought, and branching out into other crops -- like cacao, avocados or trees that produce construction-grade wood.Nongovernmental and public-private initiatives have also taken root in coffee-growing regions of Central America and around the world to help guide farmers. Some have received the backing of the world's biggest coffee sellers -- like Starbucks, Tim Horton's and Lavazza -- trying to ensure their future supply.Yet even the application of best practices is no guarantee that everything will be fine.\"The weather is crazy,\" said Carlos Pena Orellana, 58, a farmer and member of a local coffee cooperative. \"Everything's out of control.\"He owns 12 acres of land but can afford to farm only about five. He gets by with income from a tomato greenhouse he built with the cooperative's help, and with remittances from two sons who migrated to the United States after struggling through the rust crisis of 2012-13.\"They're helping to revive the farm,\" he said at his ramshackle ranch one recent afternoon. \"It's really difficult now.\"He turned to his youngest son, Carlos, 12, and saw a future migrant. Pointing a leathery finger, he said: \"You're next, right?\" Mr. Pena chuckled. The boy squirmed, saying nothing."},

As you may have gathered, I have a toddler, a kid who (lucky for me) goes wild for food. One of the joys of being with her lies in giving her something unequivocally awesome to eat for the very first time, and then watching her reaction. Over the weekend, that something unequivocally awesome was a hot dog.When she likes something, she points insistently until she can have more, or squeals and waves her arms as though she's splashing in a pool. When it's love, she goes silent. (Adults, by the way, do this last one, too. The first time I made Samin Nosrat's , the entire table went quiet.)The hot dog was met with that reverent silence, and then a pure and frenzied burst of happiness. (Followed by tears, but that's another story.) And I thought: We should eat hot dogs more often. So this week is devoted to dinners that are so cymbals-clashing good that everyone loses their minds. This is subjective, of course, as is everything related to food, so you tell me what works for you: .Here are five dishes for the week:Heaven is a big bowl of spicy noodles, a crunchy cabbage salad, herby tahini sauce, lemony scallions and an invitation to do up your bowl however you want. This Alison Roman recipe gives you options: Make just the noodles and the salad, or the noodles and one of the sauces. Or go big and make it all. It's vegetarian, but it could be smart, if you were inclined, to roast extra chicken from the recipe below and shred it to add to the mix.This is that incredible Samin recipe, famous from , and if you use bone-in thighs you could do it after work on a Monday. Marinate them as directed -- which means you need to plan 12 to 24 hours ahead -- and use plain yogurt if you don't have buttermilk. Arrange the thighs in the pan without crowding them; you want some room around them, so use a second pan if need be. Roast for about 40 minutes at 425 degrees. Glorious. Serve with a big salad and potatoes or good bread.This very easy vegetarian recipe has a devoted fan base, and there are good ideas for variations in the comments, for anyone who wants to play around with it. It is practically begging you to serve it with crisp, crusty . Don't say no. (Broccoli or broccoli rabe would also be a great addition.)I know, suggesting that you make pizza isn't exactly reinventing the wheel. But still: Don't skip homemade pizza! The excitement when it emerges from the oven is really extraordinary. This one feels virtuous, with those greens on top, but I also have my eye on this by Melissa Clark. And for the record I feel pizza counts as homemade even if you buy the dough, though if you were industrious or love a little project you could make the dough ahead and freeze it; here's for that.This Korean-Chinese-Italian recipe is shockingly good in a way that stays with you days after you've eaten it. The onions cook for at least 20 minutes, and so until recently I'd never made it on a weeknight. Then I heard a rumor that , one of our video producers, caramelizes his onions ahead. And so I did that, too, cooking the onions on a Sunday while I had other pots going for dinner that night; later in the week, finishing the recipe was a breeze. If you don't have a wok, use a very large skillet. "},

Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, set a new deadline for compliance, April 23, and warned that if the Trump administration did not reply by then, its \"failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request.\"The suggested Democrats are prepared to take their request -- made through a little-known provision in the federal tax code -- to court if necessary, initiating what could be a protracted legal fight over Congress's oversight powers. In it, he cited legal precedent that he argued clearly showed the law is on the committee's side, and said that the executive branch had no right to \"second guess\" its motivations.[]\"I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding my request and the authority of the committee,\" Mr. Neal wrote. \"Those concerns lack merit. Moreover, judicial precedent commands that none of the concerns raised can legitimately be used to deny the committee's request.\"The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Saturday that he had read Mr. Neal's letter but made no commitments about complying with the request by the new deadline, which he described as \"arbitrary.\"\"I feel a responsibility that we get this right and that the I.R.S. doesn't become weaponized like it was under the Nixon administration,\" Mr. Mnuchin said during a news briefing on the sidelines of the annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.Mr. Mnuchin said that Treasury lawyers were studying the lawfulness of the request with the Justice Department. While he said that he would follow the law, he made clear that he had serious concerns about protecting the privacy of the tax returns of all taxpayers, including Mr. Trump.\"I don't think these are simple issues,\" Mr. Mnuchin said. \"They are constitutional issues.\"House Democrats, anticipating an increasingly likely legal fight over the Ways and Means action, have also taken steps to open a side door into Mr. Trump's finances. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, informed Republicans on Friday that he intended to issue a subpoena in the coming days to compel Mazars USA, an accounting company tied to the president, to turn over relevant financial records in its possession.Republicans balked at the request, calling it an \"astonishing abuse\" of the committee's powers. But Mr. Cummings said he had the authority to investigate potential wrongdoing by Mr. Trump and testimony from Michael D. Cohen, his longtime fixer, that the president had intentionally misrepresented his assets and liabilities to suit his needs at a given moment.\"The committee has full authority to investigate whether the president may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office, to determine whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions, to assess whether he is complying with the emoluments clauses of the Constitution, and to review whether he has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities,\" Mr. Cummings wrote, hinting at the broad scope of his own investigation.This month, Mr. Neal six years of Mr. Trump's personal and business tax returns, ending months of speculation about when newly empowered Democrats would make a request and how they would justify it.Mr. Trump himself has made abundantly clear he does not intend to relent on his yearslong objections to turning over his tax returns, and his personal lawyer has urged the Treasury Department to fight Mr. Neal's request.On Wednesday, just before Mr. Neal's initial deadline for compliance, the Treasury Department said the legality of the request but cast doubt on his assertions to having a legitimate legislative purpose to do so. Mr. Mnuchin wrote that he was consulting the Justice Department to draft a response, but did not indicate how long that would take.\"The committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose and the constitutional rights of American citizens,\" Mr. Mnuchin wrote. \"The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically motivated disclosures of tax information, regardless of which party is in power.\"Mr. Trump has defied modern political norms and refused to release any of his tax returns, either as a candidate or as president. He has repeatedly claimed, including as recently as Wednesday, that he is under audit by the I.R.S. and therefore cannot make the documents public as every other presidential nominee has done for decades.But no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing returns while under audit, and the I.R.S. automatically audits the returns of all presidents and vice presidents while they are in office.Mr. Neal says it is a committee investigation of that mandatory presidential audit policy that necessitates seeing Mr. Trump's returns.Mr. Neal is relying on a little-known provision in the federal tax code, Section 6103, that dates to the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920s and gives the chairmen of Congress's tax writing committees unique powers to request tax information on any filer. The code itself gives the executive branch little wiggle room in responding, stating only that the Treasury secretary \"shall\" furnish the information upon request.Legal scholars who have studied the provision and Mr. Neal's request believe that if the Treasury Department does object, it will argue that the Ways and Means chairman has overstepped Congress's oversight authority by making a request that lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and is meant only to achieve a political end. A resulting legal fight could ultimately make it to the Supreme Court and have significant implications on the expansiveness of Congress's investigative powers.Republicans on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump's White House aides, and , have all argued that Democrats are merely out to politically embarrass the president and urged the I.R.S. and Treasury Department to reject their request as illegitimate.Mr. Neal's letter on Saturday punched back at some of their objections. Notably, it was addressed not to Mr. Mnuchin but to Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, whom Democrats believe should make the decision himself.At the news briefing on Saturday, Mr. Mnuchin defended his decision to oversee the request, noting that the Treasury Department supervises the tax collection agency.Mr. Neal argued that the statute in question was clear that Mr. Rettig must hand over the information. But he added that the administration had no authority to question how the committee would handle the information or the validity of its legislative purpose.\"There is no valid basis to question the legitimacy of the committee's legislative purpose here,\" Mr. Neal wrote, citing a 1957 Supreme Court case, Watkins v. United States, as saying Congress's investigative powers were \"broad\" and \"encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes.\"But legal scholars say that the administration could seek to cite the same 1957 ruling against the committee, because it also holds that while the powers of Congress to investigate are \"broad,\" they are also \"not unlimited.\""},

Analysts worried that the Fed was steering the economy into recession.And President Trump was furious.Four months later, Mr. Powell and the Fed have mostly repaired the damage, ending a steady march of interest rate increases and signaling that their next policy move may well be a rate cut if the economy continues to soften. Markets have rallied and recession fears have cooled. But one challenge has only worsened for Mr. Powell: Mr. Trump and his escalating anger at the Fed.The president's relentless attacks on the central bank, which he blames for slowing United States economic growth, are putting Mr. Powell in a bind as he tries to bolster the economy without feeding fears that he is buckling under political pressure and damaging the integrity of an independent Fed.Publicly and privately, Mr. Powell rejects any suggestion that Mr. Trump has influenced his, or the Fed's, actions. Mr. Powell said this year that he would not resign if the president asked him to. Associates say he is prepared to fight any attempt by Mr. Trump to try to fire him.Yet while Mr. Powell repeatedly denies that Mr. Trump is changing the Fed's course, the central bank has largely moved in the direction that the president wants. For now, there is little distinction between Mr. Trump's view that rates should stay low because the economy is strong and the Fed's view that rates should remain low because the economy is fragile.How Mr. Powell handles the next few months will be a critical test of his leadership skills. A year into his chairmanship, Mr. Powell is trying to guide the Fed through a in the global economy, with slowing growth in Europe and China as well as in the United States, which is feeling the waning effects of Mr. Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut and pain from his trade war.After four consecutive interest rate increases last year on the back of an accelerating economy, Mr. Powell is now executing an abrupt shift in the Fed's efforts to balance growth and inflation concerns, while under assault from the president who appointed him to the job -- and now regrets it.\"Well, I personally think the Fed should drop rates,\" Mr. Trump . He has said he intends to like Herman Cain and Stephen Moore to the Fed's seven-member board -- two partisan candidates whose appointments would be a departure from the tradition of Fed leaders, who are more insulated from politics.Mr. Powell is , chosen by Mr. Trump in part because he fit the president's \"central casting\" image of a central banker. According to interviews with colleagues, friends and lawmakers, Mr. Powell has spent the past several months pushing the Fed toward more growth-oriented policies, not because Mr. Trump is demanding it, but because he believes economic data have given the Fed no other choice.\"One thing that has served him well, and has served the committee well, is to always take a fresh look at what's happening,\" said John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee. \"Not get caught up in 'We said this in September,' or, 'We said this in November,' but really to say, 'What do we think is right?' He's focused on, 'Let's get it right, and then let's do our best to explain it, in terms of why we've shifted our views.'\"Mr. Powell's difficulties festered for much of last year, as the economy soared with stimulus from Mr. Trump's tax cuts, more government spending and increased business confidence. Unemployment fell below 4 percent -- approaching five-decade lows -- wages began to climb and economic growth was heading toward 3 percent.The Fed, convinced the economy could withstand higher borrowing costs, raised rates three times. But in the weeks leading to the Fed's final meeting of 2018, ominous signs began to emerge, suggesting that China's economy, and the global economy as a whole, was slowing. A key indicator based on bond prices was flashing warnings of a possible recession. Yet the Fed raised rates a fourth time at that December meeting, a move that even some Democratic economists called unnecessary.Mr. Powell tried to pull off what Fed insiders call a \"dovish hike\" -- raising rates while conveying to markets that the end of such increases was in sight. But in Fed forecasts released that day, it in 2019.Markets, already spooked, plunged during a news conference after the meeting, as investors interpreted Mr. Powell's comments as suggesting more rate increases were coming soon, even if the economy slowed. Perhaps most worrisome to investors was his suggestion that another tool it had been deploying to remove stimulus from the economy -- the shrinking of its giant portfolio of bonds -- would continue on \"autopilot.\"In the days that followed, Mr. Trump and his allies called for Mr. Powell to resign or be fired.\"If only the Fed would loosen up a bit so that we don't have a recession,\" Mr. Moore, the conservative economic commentator whom Mr. Trump intends to nominate to the Fed board, said in a radio interview in December. He argued that the president could fire Mr. Powell for \"cause,\" saying the Fed chairman was \"wrecking our economy.\"Mr. Powell spent the holidays holed up at a family gathering in South Florida watching financial market swings, negative corporate news and shaky economic data -- and plotted a way to correct the mistakes. He scratched out bullet points on a notepad and waited for an opportunity to publicly pivot.In early January, armed with his handwritten bullet points and arrows signifying the sequence in which he intended to deliver them, Mr. Powell on the Fed's outlook at an American Economic Association panel in Atlanta.This time, Mr. Powell left no chances. He made clear that the Fed would react accordingly if the economy showed signs of weakness and \"wouldn't hesitate\" to change its approach to winnowing its giant portfolio of government-backed bonds.The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index soared 3.4 percent.On this occasion, Mr. Powell was driving the policy shift himself. While the Fed makes policy through a committee of representatives from reserve banks around the United States, he had not had time to make phone calls to most of the other 16 officials before changing the tone.Several weeks later, the Fed released a unanimous statement saying it would \"be patient\" as it determined the path of interest rates.In March, the Fed left rates unchanged in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent and downgraded the 2019 growth forecast, citing global slowdowns. In his news conference, Mr. Powell left open the possibility that the Fed's next move on interest rates could be a cut. He also said that the Fed planned to stop shrinking its portfolio of government bonds, known as quantitative tightening, later this year.While economists and investors applauded the move, , blaming Mr. Powell for slowing what he believed would have been even stronger growth in 2018 and putting the economy at a disadvantage.\"Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, & Stock Market, would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!\" Mr. Trump .This month, the to cut rates and to resume efforts to pump up the economy by buying bonds, a tool it previously used to help lift the economy out of recession.Among colleagues, Mr. Powell has emphasized the importance of not letting political considerations cause the central bank to err in either of two directions. One risk would be to bend toward the will of elected officials, which could put the economy's long-term stability at risk.He has also mentioned a more subtle risk: stubbornly insisting on doing the opposite of what a president seeks to prove independence, and in that way doing the wrong thing. That, too, could be viewed as political interference.\"He's in a world where there is inevitably going to be speculation about a political motive,\" said Janet L. Yellen, Mr. Powell's predecessor as Fed chief. \"You can't avoid that. The only reasonable thing you can do is get it all out of your head and make decisions based on facts and analysis, and that's what Jay is doing.\"Some Democrats, particularly in the Senate, have praised Mr. Powell for standing firm against Mr. Trump, while criticizing him and the Fed for a string of recent actions to loosen banking regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis.Other lawmakers who have spoken with Mr. Powell in recent months say they have not agreed with his decisions but view him as doing the best he can.Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Banking Committee, gave Mr. Powell a \"B, B-plus\" grade, while contending that the pressure from Mr. Trump reflects a president's typical desire to build a \"thriving economy.\"Mr. Powell \"has done a good job trying to find a balance and equilibrium between trying to allow an economy that is really hot not overheat,\" Mr. Scott said, \"while also not throwing a wet blanket over it.\"Another committee member, Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota, called the possible nominations of Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain \"an attack on Fed independence\" but said she was confident Mr. Powell would not be affected by them.\"I think that he is walking a very fine and difficult line,\" Ms. Smith said. \"He should be motivated by what he thinks is the right thing to do, and not political pressure. Having talked to him, I think he's keenly aware of that -- of not becoming somebody's political tool.\"Even some White House officials say Mr. Powell has impressed them with his poise -- and his pivot.A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss the Fed, said Mr. Powell handled the criticism \"gracefully.\" Asked what Mr. Trump thinks of Mr. Powell now, the official paused before finally answering.The president would \"like to see lower rates,\" he said."},

Bond funds were up 3.8 percent, and international stocks rose 11.1 percent, with funds that focus on China and other emerging markets doing best.But some market strategists worry that the Fed has been trying too hard to please investors.\"Central banks feel pressure to act when they should do nothing,\" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \"That's a terrible message: 'Don't worry because we'll be there for you.'\"The Fed abruptly signaled, just as 2019 began, that it was shifting to an easier monetary policy when there were unmistakable signs that economic growth was flagging. The Fed's benign message sent stocks to the best January in more than 30 years after the worst December in nearly a century.But when the central bank reiterated its relaxed posture last month, promising not to raise interest rates this year, the reaction in the stock market was less enthusiastic, and bond yields sank, a sign of concern about economic prospects.Traders who keep faith with the Fed may feel vindicated by its decision to move in a dovish direction and no doubt will continue to support share prices.But the Fed has come under pressure from President Trump to be more dovish still. And some investment advisers detect a whiff of desperation in the Fed's efforts to keep the economic recovery and bull market going into their second decade. They question how long either can continue before a painful reckoning.Highlights of mutual fund performance in the first quarter.Leaders and LaggardsStocks vs. BondsAmong general domestic stock funds.Average returns, by fund category.12 MONTHS1ST QTR.LEADERS12 MONTHS1ST QTR.General stock funds+-++6.03.33.24.6%++++13.611.13.82.6%Alger SmidCap Focus++++++-+22.027.321.522.225.525.014.531.0%++++++++30.630.628.027.927.827.127.126.5%International stocksMorgan StanleyInst.

CoreCGM FocusBy The New York Times | Source: Morningstar\"They screwed up badly by making us worry they're out of bullets,\" said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. \"You don't say you're going to guarantee no rate hikes until 2020. What are they so scared about all of a sudden?\"The short answer: a recession.By one important measure, the economy is doing nicely; the unemployment rate was 3.8 percent in March, close to a 50-year low. But that tends to be a lagging indicator, as employers are reluctant to let workers go until they have no choice. Much other data, related to factors as diverse as housing, borrowing, consumer confidence and manufacturing, hints that the decade-long economic expansion may be in jeopardy.The stock market was happy to put its faith in the Fed's renewed commitment to buoy the economy through most of the first quarter; even after losing a bit of ground in the final week or so, the S&P 500 rose 13.1 percent. But bond traders seem unconvinced.The yield on 10-year Treasury issues sank from about 3.2 percent in October to 2.44 percent on March 22, less than the 2.45 percent rate on three-month Treasury bills. That condition, an inverted yield curve, didn't last long. The 10-year rate on Thursday was 2.5 percent; the three-month rate, 2.36 percent. But the brief inversion suggested that investors were anticipating slow growth for a long time, dovish Fed or not.Although the extent of the Fed's ability to influence the markets is open to debate -- the changes it makes to the interest rates it sets tend to follow changes in market rates -- Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, said the Fed could support the stock market if other factors, such as valuations, cooperated.\"If it's very overvalued and the Fed cuts rates to help, it's not going to prevent a correction,\" he said.Mr. Sri-Kumar expects the Fed to reduce interest rates in June and September. Valuations are reasonable enough, in his opinion, that \"the Fed has a chance\" of propping up stocks, but if it continues to cut after that or begin a new round of asset purchases, even with stocks doing well, it may prove counterproductive.\"The Fed is going to help the stock market for some time, but by the end of 2019, it will run out of options,\" he said. \"If valuations are much higher than today and the Fed says it's going to keep the rally going, then people will say, 'The Fed probably knows something about the economy, so I'll sell.'\"What everyone seems to believe about the economy is that it's on less stable footing than last year.The Baltic Dry Index, which measures the cost of carrying bulk goods by ship, plunged more than 30 percent in nine months, to a three-year low. Defaults on loans to American farmers recently hit a nine-year high, and a record number of car loans are 90 days past due.The economic picture abroad is worrisome, too. Growth in China has subsided as frosty trade relations with the United States linger. As uncertainties remained over exactly how Britain would detach itself from the European Union, the Bank of England last month reported reductions in growth in construction and retail sales, and a decline in manufacturing output. German industrial orders just recorded their biggest year-on-year drop since 2009, raising recession fears there.The slowing growth is filtering through to corporate earnings. The companies in the S&P 500 are estimated to have made 4.1 percent less in the first quarter than in the first quarter of 2018, according to FactSet Research. The firm foresees a modest pickup for the full year to 3.6 percent growth.For many market professionals, it's a question of when, not if, the economic and earnings backdrops become too feeble and stocks suffer another fall.Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, says the clock is ticking.\"If the Fed's not going to raise rates tomorrow, that's fine,\" he said, \"but there's a sense that this is the end of the cycle.\"The Fed's about-face \"was a very powerful buy signal\" and a \"major reset of expectations,\" Mr. Levkovich said, but manufacturing has looked weak for several months, based on orders for durable goods, surveys of purchasing managers and German exports to China.Another concern is surveys indicating more rigorous standards on commercial and industrial loans, which \"tightened up sharply in the fourth quarter,\" he said. Changes in lending standards tend to be felt in the economy about nine months later, he noted, so \"late in the third quarter or in the fourth, we're likely to see some softening up of economic data and earnings.\"Mr. Levkovich expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2,850, near where it is now, and it could reach 2,950 before easing. Until then, economically sensitive areas that weakened as growth slowed, such as energy, semiconductors and capital goods, could outperform, he said, and if you're looking for something safer as a hedge, try big pharmaceutical companies.Ian Mortimer, co-manager of the Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators fund, also likes semiconductors, one of several technology niches that he expects to grow even in an iffy economy, including payments and e-commerce. These tech segments can capitalize on the expansion of data centers and the development of artificial intelligence and the internet of things, or the use of internet connections to enhance the use of everyday, real-world objects.\"These secular-growth themes continue to grow regardless of what the market is doing,\" he said. By contrast, \"older industries are feeling pressures.\"Mr. Paolini at Pictet called the first-quarter rally \"an overreaction to an overreaction\" and warned that \"the next big move is going to be down, not up.\" But while he sees \"lots of headwinds\" preventing the market from rising in the short term, he added, \"I don't see a clear catalyst for a significant decline.\"He finds more opportunities overseas. American defensive stocks may be expensive, for instance, but a higher proportion of British stocks are in defensive sectors, and they are much cheaper, he said. When signs of a recovery in global growth appear, he would put more money into Continental Europe, where economically sensitive stocks are reasonably priced, and Japan.Mr. Paulsen expressed concern about the yield curve, but he saw few other harbingers of recession. Household debt is well behaved, and the leading indicators index, a basket of economic measures that tend to move ahead of changes in economic growth, is at a record high.The sharp decline in bond yields and the correction last year have taken the backdrop for stocks \"from hostile to hospitable,\" he said. He also noted that sentiment is \"so bearish and cautious,\" which often occurs closer to bottoms in stocks than tops.He's not bearish, but he is cautious. Whatever an investor's neutral allocation to stocks would be, he recommends committing slightly more, particularly in foreign markets and in economically sensitive niches like energy, basic materials and industrials.As important a signal as the inverted yield curve may be, Mr. Paulsen suggested that it might be sending a false signal because it has occurred under the unorthodox practices and unique conditions engineered by the Fed after the financial crisis a decade ago. He wouldn't bet much on the economic expansion or the bull market persisting, but he wouldn't bet much against it, either.\"I like the odds that we're overestimating risks, but that's not to say it's not the start of 2008 again,\" he said. \"Everything about the Fed has been weird in this cycle. If this has the weirdest ending, it shouldn't shock us, but that doesn't necessarily mean a bear market. What if we had another five years of recovery? There are a lot of different weird ways this could go.\""},

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail,\" Senator Cory Booker pitched his campaign for president in newly urgent terms on Saturday, declaring that \"we are here today to say we can't wait\" as he laid out his vision for addressing the economic and social ills of the country.In what was billed as the major hometown rally kicking off his campaign, Mr. Booker spoke to a late-arriving but enthusiastic crowd at Military Park, in a city that was once a symbol of urban despair but has credible claims of an economic and cultural resurgence. Mr. Booker combined his familiar themes of unity with specific policies to close the racial wealth gap, repair what he considers a broken criminal justice system and set the country on a path to be a leader in climate change.\"We can't wait when powerful forces are turning their prejudice into policy and rolling back the rights that generations of Americans fought for and heroes died for,\" Mr. Booker said. \"We can't wait when this administration is throwing children fleeing violence into cages, banning Muslims from entering the nation founded on religious liberty, and preventing brave transgender Americans from serving the country they love.\"The event also marked a kind of apex of Mr. Booker's focus on Newark, a city he mentions more often on the campaign trail than his own name, hoping that the city's rocky yet resilient rise can help propel him to the top of a crowded Democratic field for the 2020 election.In a race that features six senators, Mr. Booker has often sought to shift the focus from his time in Washington to his tenure in what is known as Brick City, when he was a young, upstart mayor who for his well-documented and social-media-fueled efforts to turn around Newark.\"There is nobody in this race who has been a chief executive officer of their state's largest city managing through a recession,\" Mr. Booker told crowds in New Hampshire last weekend.But it is a pitch that is not without risk.While Newark, which has a population of 285,000, is clearly in the , it still struggles with crime and poverty. The median household income is roughly $20,000 less than the national average, and more than 28 percent of the city's residents live below the poverty line, .And Mr. Booker's tenure in Newark was not without blemishes. The Police Department, plagued by decades of mismanagement and corruption, was and placed under a consent decree. The results were mixed for a highly touted $100 million investment in Newark schools by Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook. And though homicides reached historic lows early in Mr. Booker's first term, crime just as he was elected to the Senate in 2013, eliciting criticism that he had stopped focusing on the city with his sights set on Washington.Ras Baraka, the current mayor of Newark, was one of those critics. But he has since , and the two have united around a message of progress sparked by Mr. Booker and brought across the finish line by Mr. Baraka (his re-election slogan last year was \"Touchdown!\").[]\"If you make your bones here, there is no place out there that can stop you in this country,\" Mr. Baraka said, referring to Newark. \"I usually tell people he got us on the field, and we took the ball and got us in the end zone. But if you can't get in the game, you don't get to win the championship. Senator Booker got us in the game.\"Amid the crowd on a surprisingly hot April afternoon, Mr. Booker basked in the city's renewal, as evidenced by the street vendors lining the park and the long shadows cast by skyscrapers, both venerable ones and new glass towers bearing the logos of Fortune 500 companies.\"When this city took a chance on me as their mayor, the chief executive of this city, I didn't wait to bring people together,\" Mr. Booker said. He continued: \"We got people to invest here. We opened new businesses, created thousands of new jobs -- and after 60 years of decline, Newark is growing again.\"Mr. Booker began his campaign for president with a video from the streets of the city he still calls home, and his campaign swings feature the near ubiquitous campaign line of \"I got my degree at Stanford but my Ph.D. on the streets of Newark.\" But he ratcheted up his focus on Newark in the weeks before the rally.In a recent campaign swing through New Hampshire, Mr. Booker recalled his much-publicized battle with Conan O'Brien, who as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in 2009 joked that a better health care plan for citizens of Newark \"would consist of a bus ticket out of Newark.\" Mr. Booker responded by recording a video \"banning\" Mr. O'Brien from the city's international airport. The tiff played out for weeks on social media and late-night shows, before Hillary Clinton stepped in to broker a peace deal.Mr. Booker, who critics sometimes charge chased fame more than his mayoral duties, paints the whole affair as a clever bit of earned publicity for his struggling city.\"That video went viral,\" Mr. Booker told a crowd at a house party in Bedford, N.H., last week. \"Every show I was going on -- I went on Jay Leno -- every chance I had I talked about the opportunities in Newark. I bragged about my city with more American eyes watching than ever before.\"Leading up to Mr. Booker's address was a cattle call of influential New Jersey Democrats, including Gov. Philip D. Murphy, Senator Robert Menendez, Mr. Baraka and Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., the Essex County executive.But as much as his home state and city were represented at the rally -- even the marching band from his launch video took the stage to warm up the crowd before Mr. Baraka spoke -- Mr. Booker continued to focus on a sense of critical national urgency.In choosing to have his kickoff rally on April 13, Mr. Booker pointed to the same day in 1963, when Dr. King first woke up in a jail in Birmingham and began writing what would become \"Letter From a Birmingham Jail.\"\"Generations of Americans have shown us what was possible when they refused to wait,\" Mr. Booker said. \"Now it's our turn. And we have work to do.\""},

He would appear to have minimal running room in a deep and accomplished Democratic field expected to grow to 20 or so -- large enough to fill two baseball starting lineups, with another contender or two left to heckle from the dugout.The case for: Why not?\"We don't have time for vanity things,\" Mr. Swalwell insisted in an interview this past week, the morning after he announced his candidacy on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" pledging to anchor his bid in a call for greater gun control. \"We're doing big things.\"That remains to be seen. But at the very least, if recent history is a guide, a run is likely to yield better things, perpetuating the victory-in-defeat incentive structure endemic to modern presidential politics.Today's primaries tend to produce one nominee but many winners. Beyond the long-shot candidates effectively auditioning for cabinet positions or building a profile (and donor base) for future races, there are prospective books to sell and television contracts to sign, boards to join and paid speeches to paid-speak. Any setback is temporary, any embarrassment surmountable.[]\"There's just absolutely no downside and only upside,\" Antonia Ferrier, a longtime Republican strategist and former senior aide to Senator Mitch McConnell, said of quixotic presidential runs. \"It is an industry of self-promotion. What better way to self-promote than run for president?\"The Democratic presidential field is more crowded than usual. Here's how it compares with past cycles.Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, has leveraged two losing presidential campaigns into an empire of folksy conservative ubiquity across television, radio and print. Ben Carson transitioned from renowned neurosurgeon to national hero of the right during a 2016 run that included an extended midcampaign hiatus . His efforts were rewarded with a job in President Trump's cabinet.Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, clawed back to national prominence seven years ago despite posing little threat to take the nomination, turning the protagonist of his wife's children's book -- a fictional elephant named Ellis -- into a kind of available for voter consumption.\"It gives you a certain stature the rest of your life, kind of like having once been speaker of the House,\" Mr. Gingrich said in an interview. \"They introduce you, and then they say, '... and former presidential candidate!' It's not bad.\"It is not. And underdog entrants have grown skilled at presenting their campaigns in altruistic terms, suggesting that finding a platform for a worthy cause is a reward tantamount to winning.[]Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman barely registering in most polls, has presented herself as the \"peace\" candidate opposed to military intervention overseas, though her willingness to visit President Bashar al-Assad of Syria wide scrutiny. Andrew Yang, a businessman and political newcomer, has found a semi-viral following with and a \"universal basic income.\"The Rev. Al Sharpton, who sought the Democratic nomination in 2004, said the experience aided his civil rights advocacy and increased his personal clout, expanding his opportunities even though he never approached serious electoral strength.\"It opened doors. I was taken more seriously and what I represented was taken more seriously,\" Mr. Sharpton said.He recalled just before the primaries and later securing an invitation to meet with President George W. Bush. \"No one in New York, when I was a tracksuit-wearing local activist, would ever dream I would sit down with a Republican president or host 'Saturday Night Live,'\" Mr. Sharpton said.Of course, it was Mr. Trump's belief in the branding powers of a presidential campaign that pulled him into the 2016 race -- and his triumph that has helped inspire successors. But Mr. Trump was already famous when he declared his intentions. And his blistering campaign style revealed a potential complication for those who see only benefits in running: Some of the top-tier contenders in 2016 -- like Jeb Bush, appraised as \"low energy\" on Mr. Trump's Twitter feed -- came away plainly diminished as national figures. (Others, like Rick Perry and Mr. Carson, joined Mr. Trump's administration.)Severe humiliation seems less likely among these Democrats, without a leading candidate who revels in savaging others in the party. In fact, for those with little to lose but an election, a national campaign appears to have grown only more attractive, even in a primary contest now teeming with 18 candidates.Many politicians look in the mirror and see a president. But at least as many look at the television, see peers with equivalent qualifications succeeding and reason that they should wander onto the set themselves.If Beto O'Rourke, a Senate-race-loser little known before last year, to the top tier of the Democratic field, what is stopping others? If -- a millennial mayor of a barely midsize city who was an also-ran in a 2017 bid to head the Democratic National Committee -- can achieve national celebrity, why can't anyone?\"I don't think anyone who runs for president does it just to boost their careers,\" said Steve Israel, the former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"At the back of your mind is the constant calculation that you can catch some wave.\"Mr. Swalwell, explaining to run, cited Mr. Buttigieg's success as evidence of his own viability. \"We're seeing generational cases being made here and they're landing,\" Mr. Swalwell said. \"It's completely reaffirmed to me that a generational candidate can connect.\"This Democratic cycle does afford uncommon courtesies to nonfavorites. Sensitive to any perception of party meddling from on high, the D.N.C. does not plan to place front-runners and long shots on separate debate stages, the so-called undercard debate format used for low-polling Republicans in 2016. Democrats who reach a minimum (and not especially stringent) threshold for polling or fund-raising will be slotted randomly into one of two debates on consecutive nights; some lesser-known contenders, including Mr. Yang, already seem poised to qualify.Rick Santorum, a Republican presidential candidate in 2012 and 2016 who has since become a political commentator on CNN, noted that his network was inviting Democratic candidates on air for hourlong town hall forums, whether or not they have gained much traction.\"There's just so many more opportunities to break through,\" he said. \"I don't know anybody who has a quasi-legitimate shot at running for president who should pass it up.\"But Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator who won 11 states in 2012 as the primary runner-up to Mitt Romney, cautioned candidates against expecting lasting personal dividends from an unsuccessful run.\"I was on the national stage before,\" he said, suggesting that his presidential campaigns had little effect on his future prospects. \"I did Fox for five years after I left the Senate. I did books. If you're someone who's relatively obscure, who's not had a national profile, I don't know. You can ask them.\"This warning was bipartisan. Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island governor who sought the Democratic nomination in 2016, said his professional life had not appreciably changed since a campaign that was most closely associated with his pitch to convert national measurements to the metric system (and that ).He still believes he deserved a longer look. \"I was in favor of bringing Snowden home, stopping drone strikes, ending capital punishment,\" Mr. Chafee said. \"But everyone screamed about metric.\"He contends that the instincts that led him into the 2016 contest, despite Hillary Clinton's overwhelming advantages, were validated by Senator Bernie Sanders's strong showing.\"I always thought there was room for somebody to take off,\" Mr. Chafee said. \"I was right. It just wasn't me.\""},

Reginald Dyer led a group of British soldiers to Jallianwala Bagh, a walled public garden in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar. Several thousand unarmed civilians, including women and children, had gathered to celebrate the Sikh New Year.Viewing the gathering as a violation of the prohibitory orders on public assembly, General Dyer ordered his troops to fire without warning. According to official figures, the 10 minutes of and more than a thousand injured.As news of the massacre became public, many hailed General Dyer's actions as necessary to keep an unruly subject population in order. For Indians, \"Jallianwala Bagh\" became a byword for colonial injustice and violence. The massacre triggered the beginning of the end of the colonial rule in India.General Dyer's very British determination to teach the colonized population a lesson was rooted in the memories of the Great Rebellion of 1857, when Indian rebels -- sepoys of the British Indian Army, peasants, artisans and dispossessed landholders and rulers -- revolted against the East India Company, killed several Europeans and brought the company to its knees in much of northern India. The British responded ferociously, decisively defeated the rebels, and carried out wanton in imperial governance.The fear and panic of 1857 was still alive among the colonial authorities in 1919. The had always portrayed its governance of India as the rule of law. But the company was in fact a conquering regime, and saw itself surrounded by the disaffection and sedition of its conquered subjects.In 1859, the British Crown assumed direct control of the colony. Forever fearful of sedition and conspiracies, the colonial government used the opportunity offered by the First World War to introduce the Defense of India Act in 1915. The wartime legislation gave the government extraordinary powers of preventive detention, to lock up people without trial and to restrict speech, writing and movement.The war's end did not diminish the government's anxiety. In March 1919, it introduced the Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act, popularly known as , which extended its wartime emergency powers into peacetime.Not long after the war began, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi had returned to India after 21 years in South Africa fighting for the rights of Indian immigrants. Gandhi was loyal to the British Empire and supported Britain in the First World War. Upon his return to India, he spent the first few years leading nonviolent struggles on local grievances.But when news of the impending Rowlatt legislation became public, Gandhi immediately expressed his opposition and called for a nationwide general strike on April 6, 1919. He asked people to engage in : Observe a daylong fast and hold meetings to demand the repeal of the legislation.Anger in the northern Indian province of Punjab was already heating up well before Gandhi called for the satyagraha. Across the state, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh nationalist leaders had been agitating against the Rowlatt Act; Gandhi's call raised the popular fervor against the law to a boil.The unrest was of particular concern to the British because Punjab was a vital economic and military asset. They had invested heavily in canal irrigation to turn the province into a food basket of the empire. The in the region, regarding the Sikhs as a \"martial race.\" By World War I, soldiers from Punjab constituted three-fifths of the British Indian Army, which was extensively deployed in the war. The combustible presence of the demobilized soldiers in the heat of the anticolonial agitation alarmed the British.Tensions mounted as Gandhi announced his decision to travel to Punjab. On April 10, the colonial government stopped the train carrying Gandhi, arrested him and sent him back to Bombay. Protesters in Amritsar clashed with the authorities; the troops killed at least 10 people. The crowd attacked government property and set fire to two banks. Five Europeans were killed, but the event that angered the British the most was the assault of Marcella Sherwood, a European missionary, who was wounded and left for dead on the street.Dispatched to Amritsar, General Dyer took control from the civil authorities on April 11. He issued a proclamation prohibiting public assembly and warning that such gatherings would be dispersed by force. Peace was restored, but the people were not cowed.On April 13, several thousand gathered in Jallianwala Bagh in defiance of General Dyer's orders. Incensed, he rode to the venue with his troops on two armored vehicles. Finding the lane leading up to the walled garden too narrow, they dismounted, marched to the ground and opened fire.The massacre made headlines worldwide. Rabindranath Tagore, the poet and Nobel laureate, returned his knighthood in protest. Winston Churchill condemned the shooting as \"monstrous.\" The government was forced to institute an inquiry commission, where the unrepentant general acknowledged that his principal aim was not to disperse the crowd but to produce a \"moral effect.\" The colonial government of India determined that General Dyer's actions were unwarranted and dismissed him from service. The fear of insurgency, kept alive by the memories of \"native treachery\" in 1857, had made violence and laws of exception part of the colonial government's arsenal of rule. General Dyer's actions stemmed from this -- a fact that the British could not officially acknowledge. Much of the colonial bureaucracy shared his views. The conservative press in London hailed him as a hero upon his return home.For Indians, General Dyer became a symbol of British oppression. When they reacted violently to the news of the massacre, Gandhi withdrew the Rowlatt satyagraha, calling his belief in Indians' readiness for his message of nonviolence a \"\" But Jallianwallah Bagh also shook his faith in British justice.A year later, Gandhi resumed the struggle against the British. He led India to independence less than three decades later, in 1947, setting into motion a process of decolonization that profoundly shaped the 20th century.The Jallianwala Bagh massacre marked the beginning of the resistance against the exceptional laws of colonial governance. Ironically, the postcolonial Indian state retained several of these laws of exception, the very same ones that people in Amritsar had died fighting against.Gyan Prakash is a professor of history at Princeton and the author, most recently, of \"Emergency Chronicles: Indira Gandhi and Democracy's Turning Point.\""},

I promptly ordered some pinot noir.\"This is truly, truly upsetting and unsettling,\" she said, \"and this low-grade panic attack I've been living under just went to orange. I had such high hopes of him being out of office before 2020.\"Ms. Metcalf is on Broadway conjuring Hillary Clinton to John Lithgow's Bill in \"Hillary and Clinton,\" a play and , whose play about another knotty marriage, \",\" won Ms. Metcalf a Tony in 2017.As Mr. Lithgow told me, \"Trump is not addressed at all, but the idea of Trump hangs in the air all through the evening.\"\"Hillary and Clinton,\" which opens at the John Golden Theater on April 18 (and on April 11), is set in 2008 on the eve of the New Hampshire primary in a hotel room scattered with a room service tray, newspapers, sneakers, slippers and socks, a computer and a Toblerone candy bar. It is a prelapsarian time when the coming anarchy of Trumpworld was unimaginable. But the entwined dynamics of the Clinton operation and marriage examined in the play are now seen as consequential factors in Trump's implausible victory.There are four characters: Hillary, Bill, Mark Penn (her chief strategist at the time, played by Zak Orth) and Barack Obama, the queen's dashing young usurper, played by Peter Francis James. Because of the dynasty element and scorching power struggles, Mr. Lithgow said, the play reminds him of \"The Crown,\" the Netflix show in which he played Winston Churchill.One thing hits you immediately as you watch Mr. Lithgow eat pizza and do a crossword puzzle and Ms. Metcalf sneakily pour a miniature gin from the minibar into her Snapple onstage: Our relationship to Bill and Hillary, who spent nearly three decades at the pinnacle of public life, is as complicated as theirs is to each other.\"I've never been in a play where the audience brought so much of their own political and emotional baggage to the experience,\" Mr. Lithgow said.The two stars, who have met Mrs. Clinton and supported her presidential bids, seemed uneasy about how the Clintons would react, and that the couple, who often go to Broadway plays, might show up one night. And indeed, Mr. Penn did come to a recent performance. There are growls from Clinton allies, some of whom wish the play would just go away. Mr. Penn, for his part, said he found the play to be \"a superb contemporary drama about relationships -- not really what happened at all but what could have happened.\"Scott Rudin, the producer, who also knows the Clintons, sent the script in advance and invited them to a dress rehearsal with no other audience members present. (Nick Merrill, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, said the Clintons have \"no plans to see the play at present.\")\"It would be impossible for an audience to watch them watch the play,\" Ms. Metcalf said. \"It would be tough for any of us to sit through somebody re-enacting our most private experiences on a stage, but ultimately I feel like I empathize, doing it.\"Mr. Rudin agreed: \"I don't think they'll ever see it. If I were them, I wouldn't see it. It's an idea of them. It's not literally them.\"The play's premise is that it's set in an alternative universe where it's Bill and Hillary but it's not. Or it is. It was originally written in 2008, after Mr. Hnath had been watching the Clintons on C-Span, but has been rewritten. Ms. Metcalf believes that knowing how Mrs. Clinton's political career ended makes the saga more poignant.Reading the play on paper, it was hard to conceive of Clinton fans liking it. It blends some things that never happened (Obama offering Hillary the veep spot if she would ramp down her campaign, and Obama trying to force Hillary out of the race by showing her some oppo research on Bill's dubious money sources for his charity work) with some things that surely did, like scorching conjugal battles. The play drills deep into the codependent partnership: sometimes complementary, sometimes competitive.\"I've always been the breadwinner,\" Ms. Metcalf said, referring to herself, but also Mrs. Clinton at times. \"It plays with dynamics in a relationship.\"The barbs between the pair elicit gasps and murmurs from the audience mingled with startled laughter. Mr. Rudin likens the play to \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" by Edward Albee, which he said he will produce on Broadway next season, directed by Mr. Mantello, with Ms. Metcalf as Martha, Eddie Izzard as George, Russell Tovey as Nick and Patsy Ferran, who just won the Olivier award for best actress in \"Summer and Smoke\" in London, as Honey.Advising Hillary to drop out, Bill says to her: \"Don't let them see you becoming a rotting corpse stinking up the place.\" Hillary tells Bill, \"You can't help but make my thing about you,\" acidly noting that she would like to get the Bill who's famous for listening and empathizing because the Bill she gets \"tramples me time after time.\"Bill tries to coach her on showing more vulnerability and torches her by saying, \"When I ran, I won,\" to which Hillary responds, \"Oh, going , are we?\"At one point, Hillary tells Bill: \"You don't want to see me get this job,\" adding: \"You don't want to be eclipsed, because you know that given the chance I will eclipse you.\" She notes that \"Most people -- that general public you're so fond of -- they actually can't name one thing that you did in office that wasn't one thing.'\"As it turned out, during the two performances I watched, the audience didn't seem turned off by the portrayal of Hillary. Ms. Metcalf, who like Hillary grew up in Illinois and has what Mr. Mantello calls \"Midwest practicality,\" was able to bring humor and humanity to the role.\"We only would have done this play with her,\" Mr. Rudin said. \"I think people love the character in the play even though the play is not a love letter to Hillary.\"He said he considers Ms. Metcalf \"the best actress in America.\"I read her : \"I like to play those characters that are so egotistical and driven, that it's like they have blinders on,\" adding that, \"you end up weirdly rooting for them. They become endearing in their myopia.\"Does that apply to Hillary?\"Yes,\" Ms. Metcalf said. \"I like her refusal to kowtow, her 'Hit me again, I've been through it all and I'm still moving forward.' I hope you get a sense of that in the play because she deserves that respect, I think.\"The actress is 63, close to the same age that Hillary was in 2008. She is slight, with short brown hair and dimples and just as cool as you hope she will be. I tell her that her legs look great in the scene where she's changing her clothes to meet Obama.\"We had an underwear discussion,\" she said, talking about her theatrical soul mate, Mr. Mantello. \"And Joe said, 'Look, I don't know about the lady stuff.' And I said, 'Frankly, I don't either.' The costume designer kept rattling off different colors of underwear, and Joe and I kept looking at her and saying, 'No, it's white. It's white and it's big.' It's like, c'mon. She's a certain age.\" Ms. Metcalf wears her own tennis shoes.She and Mr. Lithgow first developed their chemistry back in 1998 when she guest-starred as a crazed love interest in \"3rd Rock From the Sun.\" In the play, he sports Clintonesque running shorts. \"They're short,\" Metcalf said, laughing. \"In fact, when he steps over me when I'm lying on the floor, it's like. ...\" She makes one of her famous rubbery faces.Mr. Mantello, who also directed Ms. Metcalf in , said that she lacks \"an actor's vanity.\" (Also, unusually, a personal publicist.) \"She doesn't squander energy and talent on today's lethal combination of endless self-promotion and humble-bragging,\" he said. Whenever he sends her a play, he said, she is eager for a chance to wear a bad wig or padded butt and maybe a fake nose. \"She's always looking for the opportunity to vomit onstage,\" he said. (\"If I can work it in, I'll work it in,\" Ms. Metcalf said, shrugging, when I asked her about the vomiting.)Mr. Mantello said the two best performances he has ever seen were Ms. Metcalf as a sweet but dim prostitute in and as a woman having a secret affair with her father-in-law in Louis C.K.'s web series, \".\", who directed Ms. Metcalf in \"A Doll's House, Part 2,\" is equally effusive: \"If you were to create the perfect actor with A.I., if would be Laurie Metcalf.\"She is the anti-diva, only \"throwing a bit of a fit\" if she sees a director is mistreating or scapegoating subordinates. She avoids social media because, she said, she has a slightly addictive personality and she doesn't want \"to go down the wormhole.\" She is monkish when she's working, abiding by a simple rule: Bring your A game, no matter what.\"A lot of people on stage and screen are posing, thinking they're cool, thinking they'll make a lot of money,\" said Ethan Hawke, of \"A Lie of the Mind,\" by Sam Shepard. \"Laurie's heart is so pure. It's like watching Jimi Hendrix play guitar.\"Ms. Metcalf dresses mostly in T-shirts and hoodies handed out by the shows she's in. Low-end swag-bag dressing? \"Yeah, so the better the project,\" she said, laughing, \"the better I look.\"Ordinarily, she likes flannel shirts so she doesn't have to wear a bra. But for our interview, she has put on her \"de facto dress-up sweater,\" mustard yellow with a bird and a heart on the sleeve, given to her by Sara Gilbert, and her Target jeans and Ugg boots. She has a knit cap she bought on the street with a pompom that looks like a lint ball.\"I don't want to have anything dry cleaned,\" she said. \"I want to throw it in hot water.\"She waved off the producer's offer of a town car to walk to the theater from her residential hotel on the Upper West Side.\"I have a really small house in Burbank, very nondescript,\" she said. \"I don't really care where I live. I chose it because it was within walking distance of the high school my kids wanted to go to. I don't want to own anything I have to worry about getting messed up or broken. Everything in it is from Ikea and Target.\"She also has a ranch in Idaho, where she spent a year being \"ranch woman\" when \"Roseanne,\" in which she was featured as the title star's neurotic sister, Jackie, first went off the air in 1997, after nine seasons. She raised sheep, had them sheared, spun the wool into balls of yarn and knitted socks.\"Horribly time consuming and not worth it in the long run, by far,\" she said.Ms. Metcalf started out working as a legal secretary in Chicago to support herself while she acted at Steppenwolf Theatre, the famous Chicago troupe, where talent like John Malkovich, Tracy Letts and Gary Sinise blossomed.She briefly joined the cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1981, the disastrous year when Dick Ebersol was in charge, but her one sketch, \"Women From Mars,\" got cut just before airtime.She won three Emmys in the 1990s for her role as Jackie. Tom Werner, one of the creators of \"Roseanne,\" said they originally intended to hire Ms. Metcalf for a small role in the factory where Roseanne worked. But they were so impressed, they asked her to come back the next day and read for the sister role.\"I can read it now,\" she replied.They asked her if she needed 15 minutes to prepare.\"No,\" she said. \"I'm happy to do it now.\"\"I've seen a lot of talent,\" Mr. Werner said. \"But I still remember how extraordinary it was to flip from one character to another in a nanosecond.\"The last three years have been Ms. Metcalf's time. \"It all started clicking,\" she said, a success she views as karma because she has worked so hard for so long.Besides her two Tonys, she got a best supporting actress Oscar nomination for playing the angry, controlling mother in \"Lady Bird,\" directed by Greta Gerwig. In a fun bit of casting, Ms. Metcalf plays Jim Parsons's mother on \"The Big Bang Theory,\" and her daughter Zoe Perry plays the same character in the prequel, \"Young Sheldon.\" Ms. Metcalf is the voice of the mother in the coming \"Toy Story 4,\" a preview of which made her cry.Yet she prefers the stage, she said.\"The camera has always intimidated me,\" she said. \"It's so close. It shows every tic. I have to work really hard to hide that I'm scared, so I kind of shut down a little bit and I don't feel as free as I do when I'm on a stage. Like I would never do a nude scene on camera, but I would do a nude scene in the theater. It's not permanent. It's like a shared experience between just those people.\"Ms. Metcalf is single, after being married and divorced from two actors. I paraphrase Tom Stoppard's line from \"The Real Thing\": \"To marry an actor once is careless but twice is inexcusable.\"She laughed. \"I worked all the time, and I only knew other actors,'' she said. \"But actors are also, you know, initially, really charismatic people.\"I suggest she get a younger boyfriend.\"No,\" she said, flatly. \"I'm done. Done. I so love being on my own. And in hindsight, I always did. I'm not cut out to share a life with somebody. I don't want to compromise. I don't want to answer to anything. I don't want to share. I'm very much a hermit anyway. Kids and acting are the only things that get me out of the house. I do a lot of car-pooling.\"She has four children; the youngest, a 13-year-old girl, is the last one at home.\"It's a horrible constant guilt trip that never ends,\" she said. \"But they have forgiven me a lot. And some part of me wants to think that it's good that they see me doing something I absolutely love and I throw a hundred percent into it.\"Ms. Metcalf has talked very little about that shut down the successful reboot of \"Roseanne\" last year.\"They made that decision in five minutes,\" she said, looking pained. \"And we were all looking so forward to coming back. The numbers were incredible. Top of its game. And I was here in town doing 'Three Tall Women,' and I had a show that night, so I was just sitting at home and I had CNN on. That's where I heard about it. The scroll at the bottom said, \"Roseanne\" show canceled.' And I thought, what happened? And then as soon as I saw what she wrote, I was like, 'O.K., yeah.'\"I don't consider her cut out of my life. I never will. But what happened, happened. And we haven't spoken since it happened.\"She said she was the last to sign on to \"The Conners\" because she was \"scared to death\" that it would fail. But then, \"we all wanted to do it for the crew, for those 200 people who counted on the work before it blew up.\"After TV Roseanne was killed off with an opioid overdose -- \"I AIN'T DEAD, BITCHES!!!!\" the real one tweeted -- Ms. Metcalf and Ms. Gilbert filmed a scene in the kitchen during which they broke down as they talked about how much they missed her.\"It was one of the only times in my life as an actor where I didn't really have to do a substitution to get to the emotion of it,\" Ms. Metcalf said. \"It was true. We missed her. We were mourning her in that scene. It was rough to go through.\"(For her part, that Gilbert \"destroyed\" her life and the show when she tweeted that Ms. Barr's racism was abhorrent. \"She will never get enough until she consumes my liver with a fine Chianti,\" Ms. Barr said of Ms. Gilbert.)The day after we meet, Ms. Metcalf is finally getting a day off. What will she do?\"I will not be leaving the apartment,\" she said. \"I will not be taking a shower. I will have enough food stocked up to eat. And just putter around and read a little bit. I will watch the news, although ...\"She remembers her unhappiness with the other Barr.\"God,\" she said, as she grabbed her knit hat, \"I just flashed on that again.\""},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/style/self-care/nonbinary-childhood-photos-jacob-tobia.html", "title": "Excavating My Childhood Photos -- and Myself", "authors": "", "contents": "Two years ago, I spent Christmas with my family in North Carolina with a mission: to digitize a dozen or so of my favorite childhood photos.Looking through childhood photos is fun for some people. \"Look back on old memories! Revel in the past!\"But if you're like most people, looking through childhood photos is an exercise in nostalgia, often with a tinge of melancholic regret. Also: It's a logistical nightmare. In my case, I severely underestimated just how many photographs my parents had in the house. Stacked one on top of another, in the living room of the house I grew up in, the boxes could have easily reached the ceiling.I wanted to find these photos because I was writing a memoir. A memoir about coming into my own as a gender nonconforming person. As I began thinking about those first chapters, about delving into my childhood, it became clear just how little I remembered. It's not that I'd blocked it out -- I have memories. I remember that, from the earliest age, I was who I was. What I struggle to remember is to be that person.And so my task was less and more I became an archaeologist of sorts -- hopeful to uncover ancient shards of my childhood gender and piece them back into the whole. Who was I before the world interfered? Who was I before my gender was shut down? I hoped that the photos could show me.As I flipped through photos that hadn't seen the light of day in two or more decades, the dust was everywhere. Eyes watering, nose itching, a sneezing mess, I rifled through print after print.Then I found it. My favorite childhood photo, one that I remember seeing years ago.Holding a bouquet of fake flowers, a 3-year-old me stands in a tutu and a floppy hat. I'm planted in the middle of my neighbor's living room, adjacent to the ottoman, posed for a picture in front of the TV set.As I turned the photograph over in my hands -- still glossy, vibrant, remarkably well-preserved -- I found myself inundated with emotion. But it was the grief, not the reminiscence, that surprised me.On the surface, the photo reveals what was readily apparent to everyone who knew me at that age: that I was a gender nonconforming child. As a young boy, my femininity was an open secret; understood by everyone, discussed by none. In carefree moments, it showed itself abundantly -- I'd frolic with the girls during playtime, reach for the sparkliest fabrics during dress up and joyfully twist my hips during dance class.Sitting on the floor in the house I grew up in, I placed the photo delicately in the \"to be scanned\" pile. This one was a keeper, for sure. It told exactly the story I needed. I started to move on to other photos, but something stopped me.I picked the photo back up, taking a second look. In my haste, I'd missed the forest for the trees. Yes, my outfit is adorable. Yes, the photo illustrates that my love for tulle began at a very early age. Yes, it is a charming relic of my sissy heritage. But once you get past the outfit, a much more significant detail emerges: the expression.The face I'm making confounds me. Surely, I was overjoyed to be wearing that skirt. As a trans child bursting with curiosity about my gender, I took any chance I could get to sport flowing fabric, don flowers and wear extravagant hats -- the kind I wasn't usually allowed to wear at home. In this particular photograph, I was doing all three. So why wasn't I smiling?Looking at it now, I have a guess as to what my blank expression was reflecting: eyes wide, corners of mouth turned ever so slightly downward, as if whatever emotion I had the moment before had been vacuumed out. Even by the age of 3 or 4, I knew that the way I expressed myself was unacceptable. I did not know the terms \"transgender\" or \"genderqueer\" or \"nonbinary,\" but as a young boy, I knew that I was not allowed to be \"girly.\" I could not wear pink, prance in dresses, hold my hips just so, or flounce about in sparkles. When I wandered to the Barbie aisle in the toy store, I would be subtly steered back to the Legos. I knew, even then, that there were parts of myself I needed to hide. There were exceptions to this rule. There were a few safe zones in my childhood, places where I could break the mold without fear of retribution. Like when I was at my next-door neighbor's house, away from my parents. It was safe there. Or when my dad was away on a business trip and my older brother was off at school and it was just my mom and me. Then I could play. In the cocoon of that privacy, for a few precious moments, I could transform. I could watch girly TV shows, color pictures of princesses or unicorns, draw pink polka-dots all over. On neighborhood walks with my mom, we'd stroll at half-pace so I could pick her miniature bouquets of wildflowers. Just me and her, I could let my femininity fly.This photograph came from one such moment, a girls-only birthday party next door that my mother (miraculously) arranged for me to attend. None of the neighborhood dads were there, just me and the girls and the moms. As my mother tells it, I dressed up and ran around in the backyard, carefree for the afternoon.But then my mom decided to take my picture. Looking at my face in the photograph, it's clear that even then I knew the stakes. Wearing a tutu in relative privacy was one thing. Being photographed in a tutu, creating evidence of my transgression (pun intended) was quite another. What if the boys from the neighborhood saw the photo? What if my dad saw it? Or my brother?Studying the photo, I recognize what made me take that second look. I am a scared child in a gorgeous outfit, and the grief is overwhelming. I wish I could protect the child in that photo. I wish I could alleviate their anxiety and pain. While it was scary to be photographed in a tutu at the time, these days I realize how important it was that my mom took the time to document my childhood gender creativity.When I asked my mom what compelled her to take the photo, she said it was simply because I was \"being adorable.\" She saw nothing revolutionary or radical about taking pictures of her child being cute. But I do.In a world that still shames children -- and later, adults -- who fall outside the gender \"norm,\" my dress-up photos aren't just cute, they're political. They are vital fragments of a history that is too often erased, proof of a gender that was. Intentionally or not, my mother armed me with an arsenal of clues, a documentation of what my identity looked like before I was taught to be ashamed of it. My mother didn't have the power to give her feminine kid a world free from stigma and shame. She wasn't able to give me a world where my gender would be understood and treated with kindness.

The spark of life that used to begin in bedrooms and the back seats of cars was now migrating out of the human body and into the lab.\"Take your time,\" the doctor continues. \"You need to first select the early- stage embryo optimal for you. The numbers across the top list the 300 options for you that we've prescreened from the initial 10,000. The column down the left lists all the disorders and traits influenced by genetics that we have some ability to predict. The numbers populating the chart are our best predictions for how the genetic component of each trait would be realized if we selected based on that trait alone. We're looking for high composite scores emphasizing the qualities most important to you.\"You scan the lists on the walls wondering if a human being can really be reduced to numbers. \"Can you really predict all of these traits?\" you ask.\"These are all probabilities, not certainties,\" the doctor says. \"Not all traits are equally genetic. And genetics is a trade-off, so we can't choose to optimize every trait. Thirty years ago we could mostly just identify disorders determined by a single genetic mutation, but in 2018 we started using what we call ' to make better predictions about diseases and traits influenced by hundreds or thousands of genes. \"Our biology is still about as complex as it's been for millions of years but the technology we're using to understand it is getting exponentially more sophisticated,\" she continues. \"There may be magic in humans, but we aren't made of magic. Our DNA is a type of source code we're learning how to read and write.\"The idea of humans as hackable data sets may be increasingly common but still unsettles you. The numbers on the wall seem to confirm the doctor's words. \"And this 60 means that embryo would be good at math?\" you ask, pointing to one of the options on the list.\"There are few genetic guarantees,\" she answers, \"but that embryo would have a greater than average possibility, with lots of other necessary environmental inputs, of being a very good pure mathematician. Comparing billions of people's genetics with their test scores over the past 30 years has taught us a lot. Many people with the potential to be great mathematicians never realize that potential, but there are probably no highest-level mathematicians without the necessary underlying genetics.\"Your mind struggles to build a case for nature as it used to seem. \"My mother always used to tell me I was perfect just as I was.\"\"And you are,\" the doctor replies. \"We all are. These would all be your natural children just the same as if you had conceived through sex or old-fashioned in vitro fertilization. We've simply increased the number of options by turning cells from the blood sample you sent us into the stem cells we used to create more eggs. The great Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka for pointing us in this direction. All of the qualities you're choosing are entirely your and your sperm donor's genetic inheritance. We aren't altering those genetics in any way, just enhancing your choice and limiting your risk.\"You still struggle with the idea that the magic of life can be reduced to a series of percentages on a chart. \"Is it really that simple?\"\"Nature is no fool. Evolution isn't random. It just made some trade-offs for us over the years that today don't always seem that great. We have to approach all of this with a healthy dose of humility.\"Scanning the wall, you don't see humility. A few low numbers catch your eye. Would it possibly make sense to implant an embryo more likely to get Type 1 diabetes or early-onset familial Alzheimer's or to die young? You know that people with genetic disorders are just different. Some of them, like some people with autism, even have powers far beyond their so-called normal peers. What would it mean to select these conditions with a simple nod? You fidget nervously. \"What if I pick to optimize a characteristic that makes sense today but could be less helpful in a different world tomorrow?\" \"If our environment changes, we need to adapt,\" the doctor says. \"But our ability to push changes more assertively has also increased rapidly since the genetic engineering revolution began in the 1970s, especially since our gene editing tools started really taking off around 30 years ago. It's not yet safe enough to make too many edits to the genomes of human embryos, but we can confidently make deletions, alterations and insertions to alter the expression of a few genes where the potential benefits seem to outweigh the risks -- like for increased resistance to some deadly viruses, greater ability to build and maintain muscle mass, or a lower risk of cancer, diabetes, familial Alzheimer's, and coronary disease. Those are all part of our premium enhancement package.\"You are relatively wealthy and living in an advanced country but it bothers you that many others can't afford or obtain this basic level of service, let alone the premium package. You wonder if it's right to select human traits as if they were features of a car, and if it's dangerous to frontally assault four billion years of evolution. You fear you might be fixing one potential problem only to inadvertently create another.But then you close your eyes and imagine your grandchildren holding your future daughter's hand as her mind deteriorates from early-onset Alzheimer's or weeping at the cemetery after her premature death. Would you really play Russian roulette with your daughter's fate? Wouldn't you want more than anything else to give her the greatest genetic opportunity to live a long, healthy and successful life?Your head suddenly stops throbbing. Your mind becomes clear. You open your eyes. \"What's the next step?\"\"You need to make hard choices ranking your priorities both for the embryo selection and the gene edits,\" the doctor says, leaning in. \"Picking everything is like picking nothing. If having a good shot at a longer life and an outgoing personality are really important to you, give those your highest ranking. If being a good long-distance runner is nice but not that important, put that lower.\"Your mind is already transfixed on the range of possible futures. You breathe in deeply.\"Shall we begin?\"Jamie Metzl (@JamieMetzl) is author of the forthcoming \"\" and a member of the World Health Organization international advisory committee on the future of human gene editing.

I wish I could pretend it has been some torrid courtship, that after much cat-and-mousing the two of us succumbed to our mutual attraction and decided to settle down and make an honest go of it, but I can't: I am in breathless pursuit, hustling to keep her updated and paid for, wooing her with expensive protective cases and as many off-brand charging cords as there are outlets in my home. She acknowledges this attention with occasional notifications, blinking on the screen, reminders to update, so many needs. That makes me want her even more.I know that having her carelessly bouncing around the bottom of my bag all day and on the nightstand inches from my sleeping face, readily available for when I need to look up \"recipes for morons\" or \"the best way to wash a cat,\" is putting my precious information at risk. My phone is always listening, and through a series of bloops and bleeps I do not understand, the data I have spewed into the universe gets sold and fed back to me in a targeted Instagram ad for whatever it is I now urgently need.I don't know how thrilled I am to be giving up my secrets, but it's foolish to think I have any control over them, and ultimately I don't care. I love convenience and entertainment too much to worry about how much information I cannot control is being leaked to marketers, retailers, the government and whatever Chinese intelligence agency controls the barrage of ads for $13 dresses that saturate my feed.Maybe it's because I got in the smartphone game late and have a real memory of how inconvenient life used to be.I'm staring down the barrel of my 40th year, and the first computer I bought for myself was six or seven years ago. I didn't get my first iPhone until they'd been around for years, partly because I was like: \"Who needs that? I prefer to live in the real world!\" but mostly because the idea of walking around with a $500 computer in my pocket seemed dangerous. And the idea that I could somehow scrape together the money to purchase said pocket computer while also maintaining a roof over my head (read: partying all the time and paying for cable) was hilarious and unrealistic. I was the last dinosaur at the club sending multi-tap texts on a Nokia E51 with no camera.When I finally upgraded, I didn't get what all the fuss was about. O.K., sure, this glowing rectangle in my bag can tell me the weather anywhere in the world at this exact moment, but who cares? Wait, it can also figure out exactly what wrong street I'm turning down and steer me back in the right direction? it counted how many steps I took? While storing all the passwords I can never remember? Please excuse me while I build this shrine to the new most important thing in my life.That is how it gets you. I was a skeptic and then I was a convert almost immediately. I have long understood that I am a tiny, powerless cog in the wheel of modern America, plus I'm not a hacker, so what do I even know about keeping things hidden? Is it even possible for me, a regular person who cannot figure out how to program the television remote, to circumvent the eyes of all of the faceless technology corporations analyzing my information? What am I going to do, cheat Amazon? Outsmart Google? No, I'm going to do what everyone else does: enter my credit card information when prompted and get that thing I need two days from when I decided I needed it.A few months ago I went to dinner with the kind of people whose idea of fun is to correct your pronunciation of \"nicoise,\" and they boldly suggested that we all put our phones face down in the center of the table for the entirety of the meal and what felt like a needlessly lingering discussion afterward.Now, I didn't die. But I also didn't know what time it was. Or if anyone had texted me. And I'm not really a \"post a picture of my fancy meal\" kind of person, but I could tell that other people wanted to. The air was heavy with missed opportunity. And you know what we talked about while cringing internally as the carafe of still water we actually had to pay for came perilously close to splashing on our helpless devices every time it was passed? TV shows, which you can watch on a phone. Books, which, if your eyes haven't already burned through the back of your skull from being on your phone all the time, you can read on your phone. Murder podcasts, which are specifically made to be listened to on a phone.Yes, your phone is potentially hazardous to whatever semblance of security you might have. Yes, there are many medical professionals who would attest to the deleterious effect modern technology has on the brains and interpersonal skills of adults. But hear me out: Maybe it's worth it?My phone knows so much about me. It knows where I am, how many steps I took to get there, the whisper of a thought I don't remember even fully forming in my brain that somehow made its way to a search engine. It also knows I am addicted, which is why it doesn't ever really have to worry about whether I'm creeped out by the digital eyes I can feel looking over my shoulder.Not long ago, Apple put a screen-time feature on the iPhone that's supposed to, I don't know, shame me into putting down the drug it won't stop selling me. I use the statistics it collects as a challenge to spend even more time messing around on my phone. Only one hour and 37 minutes of social networking yesterday, you say? Let me put this informative book I was reading down and try to top that. But my phone already knows that's what I'd want to do.Samantha Irby () is the author of the essay collections \"Meaty\" and \"We Are Never Meeting in Real Life.\""},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/opinion/china-internet-privacy.html", "title": "The Only Answer Is Less Internet", "authors": "Ross Douthat", "contents": "In our age of digital connection and constantly online life, you might say that two political regimes are evolving, one Chinese and one Western, which offer two kinds of relationships between the privacy of ordinary citizens and the newfound power of central authorities to track, to supervise, to expose and to surveil.The first regime is one in which your every transaction can be fed into a system of ratings and rankings, in which what seem like merely personal mistakes can cost you your livelihood and reputation, even your ability to hail a car or book a reservation. It's one in which notionally private companies cooperate with the government to track dissidents and radicals and censor speech; one in which your fellow citizens act as enforcers of the ideological consensus, making an example of you for comments you intended only for your friends; one in which even the wealth and power of your overlords can't buy privacy.The second regime is the one they're building in the People's Republic of China.This is a dark joke; it isn't meant to minimize the horrors of China's march into information-age totalitarianism. Beginning with its successful taming of the internet, Beijing has treated the darkest episodes of \"Black Mirror\" as a how-to guide for social control and subjugation -- with \"social credit\" scores and official public shamings for people whose daily conduct disappoints, that you'd use if you know what's good for you, surveillance technologies and facial recognition software as boots on the back of nonapproved religions, and compulsory internet as part of the brutal, tech-enabled imposed in China's Muslim west.What's happening in the West with privacy and authority is happily different. Unlike China's system, our emerging post-privacy order is not (for now) totalitarian; its impositions are more decentralized and haphazard, more circumscribed and civilized, less designed and more evolved, more random in the punishments inflicted and the rules enforced.This means that, for instance, there is no central party apparatus encouraging our corporations to create individual \"\" for every consumer (even if they're still doing it), no official commissars organizing digital mobs (even if shaming for random wrongthink is now a commonplace), no political persecution involved in most cases where public figures have their secrets and selfies exposed on the internet. (Perhaps Jeff Bezos's claims of Saudi involvement will pan out, but so far he mostly seems to have been the victim of his own stupidity and his mistress's brother's greed.) And it means that the radicals surveilled by corporate-government cooperation are mostly white nationalists and jihadists, not human rights advocates and Christian pastors, as in China.But this list of real differences is still also a list of partial similarities, of ways in which the architecture of our system replicates certain features of the emergent Chinese panopticon, even if the life lived within our system is still blessedly freer than in theirs.Indeed our system cannot help recreating features of the Chinese order, because the way that we live on the internet leaves us naked before power in a radical new way. In the West that power is still decentralized, diffuse, divided and polarized, and therefore likely to be limited and checked. But to adapt Deng Xiaoping's famous call for \"socialism with Chinese characteristics,\" the Western order in the internet age might be usefully described as a \"liberalism with some police-state characteristics.\" Those characteristics are shaped and limited by our political heritage of rights and individualism. But there is still plainly an authoritarian edge, a gentle aspect, to the new world that online life creates.And what's striking is how easily we have come to tolerate it. Yes, there are moments when particular organs of surveillance get pushback -- the N.S.A. during the brief \"libertarian moment\" starring Rand Paul and Edward Snowden, the social media companies from liberals when it turned out that the Trump digital team no less than the Obama whiz kids could exploit their user data.But apart from the high-minded and the paranoid, privacy per se is not a major issue in our politics. Most people want the convenience of the internet far more than they want the private spaces that older forms of communication protected. They shrug off the stalker-ish ways that corporations hurl their ads at you throughout your day. They put surveillance devices in their homes and pockets without a qualm. They accept hackings and online shamings the way a Californian shrugs off earthquakes. They assume that the extremists being surveilled and censored and sometimes arrested probably deserve it. And they welcome the possible advantages of panoptical living, hoping for less crime and less police misconduct, better public health, more exposure of corruption -- plus, of course, the chance to see their favorite celebrities in the nude.So for those who object inherently to our new nakedness, regard the earthquakes as too high a price for Amazon's low prices, or fear what an Augustus or a Robespierre might someday do with all this architecture, the best hope for a partial restoration of privacy has to involve more than just an anxiety about privacy alone. It requires a more general turn against the virtual, in which fears of digital nakedness are just one motivator among many -- the political piece of a cause that's also psychological, intellectual, aesthetic and religious.This is the hard truth suggested by our online experience so far: That a movement to restore privacy must be, at some level, a movement against the internet. Not a pure Luddism, but a movement for limits, for internet-free spaces, for zones of enforced pre-virtual reality (childhood and education above all), for social conventions that discourage career-destroying tweets and crotch shots by encouraging us to put away our iPhones.Absent such a movement we may not join China in dystopia. But the dystopian elements in our own order will be here to say."},

That phone in your pocket, the surveillance camera on the corner: You've traded away a bit of anonymity, of autonomy, for the usefulness of one, the protection of the other.Many of these trade-offs were clearly worthwhile. But now the stakes are rising and the choices are growing more fraught. Is it O.K., for example, for an insurance company to ask you to wear a tracker to monitor whether you're getting enough exercise, and ? Would it concern you if police detectives felt free to collect your DNA from a discarded coffee cup, and to share your genetic code? What if your employer demanded access to all your digital activity, so that it could run that data through an algorithm to judge whether you're trustworthy?These sorts of things are already happening in the United States. that public anxiety about privacy is growing, as data breaches at companies like Facebook and Equifax have revealed how much information we've already traded away -- and how vulnerable we can find ourselves when it's exposed. Following the example of the European Union, which toughened its privacy regulations last year, officials in city halls, state capitals and Washington are considering new rules to protect privacy. Industry leaders are scrambling to influence that debate, and to rewrite their own rules.It seems like a good moment to pause and consider the choices we've already made, and the ones that lie ahead. That's why Times Opinion is launching The Privacy Project, a monthslong initiative to explore the technology, to envision where it's taking us, and to convene debate about how we should control it to best realize, rather than stunt or distort, human potential.We mean for this exploration to be thorough and the debate to range widely, from arguments for to whether, through their access to detailed information about so many of us, corporations and politicians have already gained dangerous power to manipulate how we perceive the world. This project will inevitably consider the work of The New York Times, along with that of other media companies, since, as , this newspaper's own commerce depends to a degree on the gathering and sharing of people's data. (So, of course, does its product -- journalism.)We intend to challenge our own assumptions and biases about technology and the nature of privacy, along with those of our readers. At first blush it seems deeply creepy to me, for example, that Shenzhen, China, is considering automatically texting fines to jaywalkers identified through face-recognition technology. But when you think about it, is that necessarily such a bad idea? After all, the law is the law, and if facial recognition could nab all violators, without the racial bias that can warp enforcement by human officers, wouldn't uses like this result in a fairer world?The reality is that right now the algorithms that do the recognizing tend to enforce, rather than overcome, racial bias. Even in private hands, and even when the gizmo is as seemingly cool and innocuous as a doorbell video camera, this new technology is already being used to in ways that seem certain to particularly hurt people of color. In the hands of the state such tools radically increase its power.We're looking to you to participate in this project. We'd like to publish your storiesabout how the sharing of your data hurt or helped you. When it comes to debating the right path forward, we hope to hear from technologists and policymakers, whistle-blowers and tech executives, advocates and academics, and anyone else who has an original and important solution or idea to contribute. Eventually, months from now, having considered this debate, the Times editorial board will weigh in with its own proposed solutions.There is no explicit right to privacy in the Constitution. The word \"privacy\" doesn't even appear. As Tim Wu writes, the notion of privacy for everyone -- rather than just for the rich -- is of . Maybe its time is passing. People may tell pollsters they're worried about their privacy, but millions are also happily paying some of the world's most all-seeing corporations to in their homes. It may be that, as some of our contributors argue, a world in which people more freely share intimate details will be a world that is more honest, and fair.On the other hand, privacy by the United Nations as a universal human right for good reason. Privacy sustains space for free thought and expression, for the growth that comes from mistakes without public shame. It's a bulwark against the power of the state and the society, the workplace and the marketplace.In recent years, as we've been blurring the boundaries between what's public and what's private, we've been doing so largely by accident, or by leaving the decisions to the vagaries of innovation and the pull of market incentives. As consumers and as citizens, we need to understand the benefits and the costs, and make deliberate choices. Rather than hurriedly consenting to someone else's privacy policy, it's time for us to write our own."},

This isn't speculative fiction -- these are real technologies being deployed by insurance companies right now. Last year, the began to offer its customers the option to wear a fitness tracker -- a wearable device that can collect information about how active you are, how many calories you burn, and how much you sleep. The idea is thatyour Fitbit or Apple Watch can tell whether or not you're living the good, healthy life -- and if you are, . This is the cutting edge of the insurance industry, adjusting premiums and policies based on new forms of surveillance. It will affect your life insurance, your car insurance and your homeowner's insurance -- if it hasn't already. If the Affordable Care Act's protections for people should vanish, it will no doubt penetrate the as well.Consumers buy insurance from companies to protect against possible losses. But this contractual relationship is increasingly asymmetrical. The insurance companies once relied on a mix of self-reported information, public records and credit scores to calculate risk and assess how much to charge. But thanks to advances in technology, the capacity to collect, store and analyze information is greater than ever before.A 2018 report from the consulting firm McKinsey notes that \"smart\" devices -- fitness trackers, home assistants like Alexa, connected cars and smart refrigerators -- are proliferating in homes. The \"\" they can provide will change the face of insurance.In 2014, the insurance company State Farm for a system that \"aggregates and correlates\" data for \"life management purposes.\" The application lists a wide range of information, such as \"home data, vehicle data and personal health data associated with the individual.\"Some of the changes heralded by these new technologies will be better for everyone, like faster claims processing. But the use of data collection and artificial intelligence also raises serious questions about what McKinsey calls \"personalized pricing\" and what the State Farm patent application calls \"personalized recommendations\" and \"insurance discounts.\"Before the A.C.A., and sold it to insurance companies, which would then deny coverage based on prescription histories. Future uses of data in insurance will not be so straightforward.As machine learning works its way into more and more decisions about who gets coverage and what it costs, discrimination becomes harder to spot.Part of the problem is the automatic deference that society has so often given to technology, as though artificial intelligence is unerring. But the other problem is that artificial intelligence is known to reproduce biases that aren't explicitly coded into it. In the field of insurance, this turns into \".\" For example, an algorithm might (correctly) conclude that joining a Facebook group for a BRCA1 mutation is an indicator of high risk for a health insurance company. Even though actual genetic information -- which is illegal to use -- is never put into the system, the algorithmic black box ends up reproducing genetic discrimination.A ZIP code might become a proxy for race; a in a resume might become a proxy for gender; a credit card purchase history can become a proxy for . Legal oversight of insurance companies, which are typically regulated by states, mostly looks at discrimination deemed to be irrational: bias based on race, sex, poverty or genetics. It's not so clear what can be done about rational indicators that are little but proxies for factors that would be illegal to consider.Placing those biases inside a secret algorithm can prevent critical examination of inequality. ProPublica found that people in minority neighborhoods paid than residents of majority-white neighborhoods with similar risk, but its reporters could not determine exactly why, since the insurance companies would not disclose their proprietary algorithms or data sets.A handful of lawsuits in other arenas have challenged this practice. After Idaho's Medicaid program started using an automated system to calculate benefits, recipients suddenly saw their benefits cut by as much as 30 percent. When the state refused to disclose its algorithm, claiming it was a trade secret, the sued to gain access to the code, and ultimately discovered that the formula was riddled with flaws.Artificial intelligence, in all its variations, holds great promise. The automated processing of car accident photos or machine reading of medical scans can help cut down costs, and even save lives. But the opacity around many applications of automation and artificial intelligence are reason for pause. Not only do people have limited access to the code that determines key facets of their lives, but the bar to understanding the \"reasoning\" of algorithms and data sets is high. It will get higher as more industries begin to use sophisticated technologies like .A. I. research should march on. But when it comes to insurance in particular, there are unanswered questions about the kind of biases that are acceptable. Discrimination based on genetics has already been deemed repugnant, even if it's perfectly rational. Poverty might be a rational indicator of risk, but should society allow companies to penalize the poor? Perhaps for now, A.I.'s more dubious consumer applications are better left in a laboratory."},

Academic triumphs, hockey tournament wins, even a little college admissions excitement. They've had rough moments too, and bittersweet ones. There have been last games and disappointments and unwashed dishes galore. If you're a friend, or even somebody who knows my mom and struck up a friendly conversation in line at the grocery store, I'd love to talk to you about any of it. I might even show you pictures.But I'm not going to post them on social media. Because I tried that for a while, and I came to a simple conclusion about getting the reactions of friends, family and acquaintances via emojis and exclamations points rather than hugs and actual exclamations. It's no fun. And I don't want to do it any more.I'm not the only one pulling back from social media. While around two-thirds of American adults use Facebook, in recent years. About 40 percent of adult users report taking a break from checking Facebook for several weeks or more, and 26 percent tell researchers they've deleted the app from their phone at some point in the past year.Some have changed their behavior because of Facebook's on protecting user data: More than half of adult users have adjusted their privacy settings in the past year. Others seem more concerned with how the platform makes them act and feel. Either way, pulling back on social media is a way to embrace your family's privacy. \"I have definitely seen an evolution toward sharing less,\" said Julianna Miner, an adjunct professor of global and community health at George Mason University and the author of the forthcoming \".\" She added, \"It's hard to tell if the changes are a response to the security breaches, or a result of people just getting tired of it.\" Even Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, seems to suspect it's at least in part the latter -- that after experimenting with living our lives in a larger online sphere for over a decade, many of us are ready to return to the more intimate groups where humans have long thrived. In , Mr. Zuckerberg announced plans to emphasize private conversations and smaller communities on the platform. Interacting on Facebook, he wrote, \"will become a fundamentally more private experience\" -- less \"town square,\" more \"living room.\"That's a shift I've already made for myself, and since doing so, I find myself asking why I embraced my personal soapbox in that online square in the first place. The more I reserve both good news and personal challenges for sharing directly with friends, the more I see that the digital world never offered the same satisfaction or support. Instead, I lost out on moments of seeing friends' faces light up at joyful news, and frequently found myself wishing that not everyone within my network had been privy to a rant or disappointment.\"There's plenty of evidence that interpersonal, face-to-face interactions yield a stronger neural response than anything you can do online,\" said Ms. Miner. \"Online empathy is worth something to us, but not as much. It takes something like six virtual hugs to equal .\" Time spent seeking those virtual hugs can take us outside the world we're living in, and draw us back to our phones (which, of course, is the reason many networks offer those bursts of feedback in the first place).\"Ultimately, you're not just giving social media the time it takes you to post,\" said Stacey Steinberg, the associate director of the Center on Children and Families at the University of Florida Levin College of Law and the author of a paper on the topic called \".\" \"The interaction doesn't end the minute you press share,\" she said. \"Some part of your mind is waiting for responses, and that amounts to a small distraction that takes us away from whatever else we would be engaged in.\" Once we post that image of our toddler flossing, we're no longer entirely watching him dance. Some part of us is in the digital realm, waiting to have our delight validated.That validation can be satisfying, but the emotion is fleeting, like the sugar rush that comes from replacing a real breakfast with a Pop-Tart. Watching your mother's reaction to the same video, though, brings a different kind of pleasure. \"I see parents sharing differently than I did five years ago,\" said Ms. Steinberg. \"We're looking for smaller audiences and ways to share just with close friends.\"She also warned that even seemingly innocuous public updates have long shadows. \"You could have a child who was a star baseball player and later decides to make a change, still being asked by relative strangers about his batting average,\" she said. \"Or one who decides on a college, and then changes her mind. Decisions are complex. Lives are complex. Marie Kondo-ing your Facebook page is not so easy.\"There are exceptions. Facebook shines as an arena for professional connection and promotion, of course. For those of us with children who have special needs, it can offer an invaluable community of support. And for the very worst of bad news -- for calamities or illnesses or deaths -- Facebook can help users speedily share updates, ask for help and share obituaries and memories.Cal Newport, the author of \",\" suggests that when we evaluate the ways we use the social media tools available to us, we ask ourselves if those tools are the best ways to achieve our goals. In those cases, the answer is yes. But for sharing personal moments, for venting, for getting good advice on parenting challenges while feeling supported in our tougher moments? I've found that real life, face-to-face, hug-to-hug contact offers more bang for my buck than anything on a screen ever could. Why cheat yourself out of those pleasures for the momentary high of a pile of \"likes\"?Recently, I ran into an acquaintance while waiting for my order at a local restaurant. \"Congratulations,\" she said, warmly. I racked my brain. I'd sold a book that week, but the information wasn't public. I wasn't pregnant, didn't have a new job, had not won the lottery. My takeout ordering skills didn't really seem worthy of note, and in fact I probably had asked for too much food, as I usually do. I wanted to talk more about this happy news, but what were we talking about? Fortunately, she went on, \"Your son must be so thrilled.\"Right. My oldest -- admitted to college.

While voters in the United States and elsewhere continue to argue the merits and security of electronic voting, India has been using secure electronic machines since 1999. Beginning in 2014, the government introduced a second machine, a printer that deposits a hard copy of each ballot into a sealed box, ensuring an additional layer of redundancy and security. Though nearly a billion people could cast ballots, there are just the computerized brain of the electronic voting machine. The machines are toted across the country for use during each geographic phase of the election. Each machine is made up of a \"control unit,\" which tallies and stores votes, and one or more \"balloting units,\" on which voters select their candidates by pressing a button.

{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/opinion/internet-privacy-regulation.html", "title": "We're Not Going to Take It Anymore", "authors": "", "contents": "Two decades ago, at the dawn of the internet age, in an era before smartphones, before apps, before all manner of devices that monitor everything from your car-hailing practices to your dating preferences, the Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy made a startling claim:\"You have zero privacy anyway,\" he said. \"Get over it!\"The in-your-face concept had the benefit of being completely prescient and even an understatement. We are now the most data-generating, most uploaded, most share-crazy humans in the history of the world, which means we are also the most monitored, the most data-chomped and, definitely, the most exposed.Our information -- much of it private -- is the rocket fuel of the ever-expanding internet. Our data keeps it humming along, even as tech companies abuse that data with increasing frequency.So here's an idea: Maybe we refuse to get over it. Maybe we start to grok what we have become, and think harder about the trades we are making for the convenience we get from our gadgets. And maybe we put in place some rules -- rules that have real teeth -- on big tech companies.The question, of course, is what those rules should look like. Some argue the United States needs a hefty, multipronged national privacy bill that would include more stringent requirements for how tech giants run their platforms. (Some even think there should be a new agency to oversee the industry.) Others think that current law will suffice, with some tweaking including better enforcement and more money for the agencies already charged with regulating the tech sector, like the Federal Trade Commission.I would argue that we need both, and fast, before these data-hungry tech companies become even more enmeshed in our lives. Do you like the idea of A.I. comparing your facial expressions to a company's top and bottom performers during a job interview? I don't. Do you want cameras in every device in your home? I don't. Do you want your television-watching linked to your search history linked to your buying data? No, thank you.I have said yes too many times before, thanks to the greatest tracking effort in the history of humanity that we facilitate every day by using a smartphone.Let me be clear -- I love technology, including my deeply felt relationship with that iPhone that spans decades now. But it has never been more urgent to put up some guardrails. While I do not consider the behemoth tech companies monsters, they can and do act monstrously. You don't have to be paranoid to realize that you are being followed, watched and crunched in ways that are breathtaking, and more than a little questionable. We need a national law to signal to these companies that the jig is up and that they need to stop abrogating their responsibilities to their users and to society itself -- and I think it's pretty inevitable we'll get one in the next few years.At the same time, we don't want to impose undue burdens on new start-ups or throttle innovation. That's why I think it would be a mistake to overreact and crack down too hard, as Europe has done in some instances. Europe has put in place strict laws like the General Data Protection Regulation of 2018, the most significant change in privacy law in decades. It gives a lot of power to individuals over how their personal data is collected and used, and is much more punitive when it comes to data breaches. There are also ePrivacy rules there that govern how people can be targeted by advertisers. Some regulations, like the exceedingly complex \"right to be forgotten,\" would slam right into free speech laws here in the United States. This week, for example, Britain proposed creating a far-reaching regulator , including their individual executives, for damaging content on their platforms.Europe's message to big tech is increasingly clear: You made this mess, so you clean it up, or else.This punitiveand suspicious sentiment had already jumped the Atlantic -- all the way across to the Pacific -- with last year. Less stringent than the General Data Protection Regulation (and criticized by some for being too soft), it makes California-based companies follow stronger data protection rules, including giving the state's consumers more insight and power over how their data is used and imposing fines when tech platforms don't comply. The law will go into effect in 2020, and there may be further additions to it. There are also privacy bills in play in at least 10 other states, so we are off and running to a confusing patchwork of laws. We need a more unified approach, because right now, our privacy regulation looks like a goat rodeo.We have to figure this out now, because more privacy-threatening technologies -- such as artificial intelligence, 5G, quantum computing, automation, robotics, self-driving cars and above all, facial recognition -- are all part of the next wave of innovation. How the tech giants share data withone another will also be an issue, because the ecosystem is increasingly intertwined.There are some countries that have gone far beyond what Americans would be comfortable with, China being the most aggressive. Beijing has created a surveillance economy that makes our current privacy issues seem trivial. The last thing we want is to get into a race over which country can better stalk its citizens. But we also need to ensure that the version of the internet that was invented in the United States -- one based on a principle of openness -- is the one that should prevail.Given how much is headed our way, I called Mr. McNealy to ask him if he felt the same about privacy now as he did in 1999.He said the harvesting of data wasunlikely to get any less invasive and noted that the information that is collected about us is like a \"digital tattoo\" that is impossible to expunge. Nonetheless, Mr. McNealy is not a fan of government regulation. He said that a federal privacy law would be a mistake because it would hinder innovation, and cautioned that the costs of compliance would hurt small companies.He also said that there are still enough alternatives to allow consumers to escape being hostages of Google or Facebook or Amazon, and that if people are concerned about those companies' data collection, they are free to stop using their platforms. \"There is nothing to be done about it but consumer choice,\" he said.Besides, Mr. McNealy said, much of the data that is being collected is not actually that dangerous. \"Amazon knows that I buy toilet paper, but who cares if it is data that does not matter?\" he asked.But at some point, I argued, it does matter. What happens if these companies go too far, and who is to decide how that data is meshed and mixed with other data? Mr. McNealy insisted that current laws, bolstered by antitrust action, should remedy any abuses.\"There are plenty of laws to deal with it if, say, Google is reading my email\" without permission, he said. \"And if these companies do abuse their power by advantaging other parts of their businesses, then regulators ought to have long, hard conversation with them.\" Until then, according to the Cassandra of privacy? \"I can live without Google, so it does not bother me,\" he said.In other words, get over it? I don't intend to, and I don't think anyone else should, either. While we may have zero privacy, it doesn't mean that we have given up our right to control our digital selves. In fact, as tech marches on, that might be the one right that needs to be protected most of all."},

{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/magazine/fried-cauliflower-recipe.html", "title": "The Secret to Fried Cauliflower That Is Savory Yet Light", "authors": "", "contents": "When I'm craving a lunch that's special but not fancy, or when lunchtime catches me by surprise, I head to the tiny restaurant Standard Fare in Berkeley. Run by Kelsie Kerr, one of the chefs at Chez Panisse who taught me to cook, Standard Fare is mostly kitchen; at lunchtime, customers turn the wide sidewalk into an ad hoc dining room, perching atop a row of metal stools with bowls of soup and focaccia sandwiches on their laps.My lunch mantra is \"as many vegetables as possible,\" so I usually order the vegetarian sandwich, which is always piled high with whatever greens and vegetables catch Kerr's eye at the farmers' market, all enriched and brightened by generous doses of sauces and vinaigrettes. But when I stopped in a month or so ago, the daily special of cauliflower steaks with turmeric-spiced chickpeas sounded equally virtuous but more satisfying. Besides, I love caramel-sweet roasted cauliflower and will take any opportunity to eat it. I was typically harried, hungry and running late, so I felt lucky when I snagged one of the few inside seats. As I turned to scan the kitchen and gauge how long it might take the cooks to prepare my lunch, Kerr brought over a plate of fried cauliflower on a bed of fragrant spiced chickpeas, all showered with herbs and sizzled cumin seeds.I hadn't expected the cauliflower to be fried, but I was delighted by the way the tender, golden crust shattered in my mouth. Fried vegetables, often overbattered and undercooked, tend to disappoint me with their tough or soggy crusts. This cauliflower, though, was savory yet light. And though it had clearly been battered, it was also somehow sweet with the sort of browning that results from long, steady roasting. I looked back at the kitchen to thank the person who'd done such a nice job of preparing my lunch. But no one was frying anything! Fried food -- especially when it's battered -- must be cooked to order and served immediately; otherwise it grows limp as it cools. And while there's plenty of pleasure to be taken in sneaking a bite of cold, leftover fried chicken from the fridge late at night, you cannot serve soggy fried chicken -- or soggy anything else -- at a restaurant. Especially if you're Kelsie Kerr, one of the most steadfast, exacting chefs the Bay Area has ever known.On my way out, I asked Kerr for her recipe. I wanted to know how she had managed the technical feat of producing cauliflower that boasted the best characteristics of both roasted and fried. \"Oh,\" she responded with a knowing chuckle that sent her freckles dancing, \"it's Ella's recipe.\" I was stunned. I met Ella, Kelsie's lithe, red-haired daughter, in 2001, when she could barely walk. It took me a moment to get used to the thought that she's now 19 and able to develop recipes that hold muster in her mother's kitchen. I begged Kerr to email me the recipe.What she sent seemed simple enough. Made with a mixture of brown rice and tapioca flours, the batter lacked gluten, which explained the cauliflower's delicate crust. When wheat flour is mixed with water, gluten strands develop and strengthen, giving structure to a batter or dough -- a characteristic desirable in a crusty loaf of bread, but less so in a light pastry or crust.When I tried the recipe at home, the cauliflower's thin batter turned an amber lace as it fried in coconut oil. By the time I flipped each slice, the batter no longer covered the entirety of the second side, but those exposed bits of cauliflower -- hugging the hot metal of the pan -- took on a dark caramel color, growing extra sweet along the way.\"When Ella was a high school sophomore,\" Kerr told me when I called her for the cauliflower's origin story, \"she invited some friends over for dinner.\" Not wanting to intrude where she sensed she was not welcome, Kerr kept quiet even as she watched her teenager battering and frying the cauliflower in advance. \"I remember thinking there was no way it'd still be crispy that evening, but I didn't say a word.\" Then, when Ella served dinner, Kerr was taken aback. \"I thought: Holy mackerel! This is delicious,\" she recounted with delight. \"I knew it was a keeper because it was a fried dish we could make ahead in batches at the restaurant and warm to order.\"Culinary progeny often end up in the kitchen alongside their parents, but I didn't remember Ella's ever showing an interest in cooking. I asked Kerr if Ella has always liked to cook. \"She has, but she doesn't like to take advice from her mother,\" she answered dryly. \"She prefers to learn from YouTube.\" I wasn't sure I heard Kerr right, so I asked her to clarify. \"Yeah, she has all of these different YouTube cooks that she loves to watch.\" Bursting into laughter, I marveled at the thought. Kerr has been cooking professionally since 1981 -- probably longer than some of those YouTube chefs have been alive. She's one of the most accomplished, knowledgeable chefs in the country. And yet, her daughter is partial to watching other folks cook online. As a student of cooking, I find this maddening. As the daughter of a steadfast, exacting mother of my own, I find it entirely relatable.When I asked Kerr how it made her feel to be upstaged by YouTube, her generosity surprised me, \"That's Ella,\" she said. \"She's so casual in her cooking. I've learned to trust her because she always does things I find suspicious, and they always turn out delicious.\""},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/opinion/sunday/taxes-public.html", "title": "Everyone's Income Taxes Should Be Public", "authors": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "contents": "In October 1924, the federal government threw open for public inspection the files that recorded the incomes of American taxpayers, and the amounts they had paid in taxes.Americans were gripped by a fever of interest in the finances of their neighbors. This newspaper devoted a large chunk of the front page to a list of the top taxpayers in Manhattan under a banner headline that read \".\" One story reported that a number of wives and ex-wives had lined up at a government office in New York to seek information about their present or former husbands. Journalists soon began to note the curious absence of some conspicuously wealthy people from the lists of top taxpayers.Congress had ordered the disclosure as a weapon against tax fraud. \"Secrecy is of the greatest aid to corruption,\" . \"The price of liberty is not only eternal vigilance, but also publicity.\" There is every reason to think that sunlight served the desired purpose. One important piece of evidence is that wealthy Americans absolutely hated the disclosure law, and soon persuaded Congress to execute a U-turn.Almost a century later, it's time to revisit the merits of universal public disclosure. Democrats in Congress are fighting to obtain President Trump's tax returns under a separate 1924 law, written in response to related concerns about public corruption. That issue could be resolved, at least in part, if Congress embraced the broader case for publishing everyone's tax bill.Now as then, disclosure could help to ensure that people pay a fair share of taxes. Americans underpay their taxes by , more than 10 percent of total federal revenue. Publishing a list of millionaires who paid little or no taxes this year could significantly reduce the number of millionaires who pay little or no taxes next year.In Norway, where tax records have been public since the founding of the modern state in 1814, a newspaper put the records online in 2001. that the records' greater availability caused a 3.1 percent increase in the reported incomes of self-employed Norwegians over the next three years, perhaps because they feared exposure.Disclosure also could help to reduce disparities in income, as well as disparities in tax payments. Inequality is easier to ignore in the absence of evidence. In Finland, where tax data is published each year on Nov. 1 -- -- people treat the information as a barometer of whether inequality is yawning too wide.Consider that public corporations are required to report the compensation of top executives -- who check disclosures of rival companies to ensure they are not underpaid. Another benefit would be identifying patterns of illegal discrimination against women or minorities. Lilly Ledbetter, for whom the is named, would have learned a lot sooner that she was making less than her male colleagues at a Goodyear plant in Alabama if she could have looked up their annual incomes on a government website.Transparency could even help to increase economic growth. People who know how much their co-workers are paid -- and how much people are paid at other companies, and in other industries -- can make better career decisions.Tax data also is a rich source of information about American life. The I.R.S. tightly limits access, but one of the few researchers allowed to work with that data, , has produced a series of important studies illuminating the mechanics of economic inequality. He and his collaborators have shown that Americans have , and that living in a good neighborhood as a child . One can only imagine what others might learn from the data.Calling for more disclosure may seem discordant at a time of growing concern about privacy. But income taxation is an act of government, not an aspect of private life. Property tax records provide a reasonable model. Local governments disclose the name of the property owner, the value of the property and the amount of taxes owed and paid. The same information should be available for income taxes -- nothing more is necessary.Another reasonable rule: In Norway, it is a matter of public record when someone looks at tax records. Everyone can see who is nosing around. Wisconsin, which makes income and tax information available on request, .Income taxation in the United States began in public view. When Congress imposed the first income tax in 1861, during the Civil War, it required the disclosure of names, incomes and tax payments. Over the following decade, before Congress ended the tax, this data was posted in public and printed in newspapers.That practice was briefly revived in 1924. It's time for another revival. The question is whether Americans are willing to endure a little sunlight in the interest of fairness and equality."}

I'm a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I'm against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \"reasonable\" elites. I've written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I'm working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I've been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \"liberal\" as an epithet, but that's basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump's presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I've written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian emigre who helped bring yoga to the West.)

I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago -- first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I've since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I'm also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today's Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges -- inequality, climate change, the rise of China -- and they'll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.This week's show is produced by Alex Laughlin for Transmitter Media and edited by Lacy Roberts.

The longer the commute, the study found, the worse the impact. The study, recently published by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Lehigh University, suggests that women who travel 50 or more miles each way to work by car may be at a \"much greater risk\" of having low-birth-weight babies (under 5.5 pounds) as well as fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction -- a condition, in which the fetus doesn't grow as fast as expected, that's with mothers who have diabetes, high blood pressure, malnutrition or infections including syphilis.Worse, for every 10 miles of travel distance added to a long commute, the probability of low birth weight goes up by 0.9 percentage points and the probability of intrauterine growth restriction rises by 0.6 percentage points, according to the study, which looked at pregnant women in New Jersey (a state with some of the longest commute times in the nation).It did not conclude what might be causing these adverse outcomes, but it found that pregnant women with long commutes were more likely to miss doctor appointments and delay treatment. Among these women, 15 percent skipped their first prenatal checkup or put off their first prenatal visit -- some as late as their third trimester.It also suggested that maternal stress, exacerbated by commuting, might be a factor. The researchers said they hoped their work would lead to policy changes to expand maternity leave to include the prenatal period. For pregnant women with long commutes, time off can be \"particularly important,\" they wrote.______That's how many Americans believe men are better suited emotionally for politics than most women, according to a new report from Georgetown University.

Mueller III's report along with underlying evidence by May 1 and promised \"major hearings\" into its findings. And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts became the most prominent Democrat to call for impeachment.But most Republican lawmakers remained silent on the report, meaning any effort to force Mr. Trump from office faced long odds barring an unexpected change of political circumstances. The months to come may see more fireworks over the report, including a constitutional clash in court over releasing it in full, but privately some Democrats have concluded that the president's fate will probably be decided at the ballot box next year.While Mr. Trump had initially greeted the report as an exoneration, he spent at least part of the day in Florida stewing about disloyal aides who talked with investigators and sounded more defensive than celebratory. He expressed particular unhappiness over the report's inclusion of granular accounts of his efforts to derail the investigation based on F.B.I. interviews and notes of his own advisers.\"Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by 18 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated & totally untrue,\" . \"Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed.\"\"Because I never agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad),\" . \"This was an Illegally Started Hoax that never should have happened, a...\"At that point he stopped and did not finish the thought until : \"...big, fat waste of time, energy and money.\" He went on to vow to go after his pursuers, whom he called \"some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes, perhaps even Spying or Treason.\"The mention of notes appeared to refer to his former White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who told investigators that the president pressed him to have Mr. Mueller fired and complained when he took notes. Mr. Trump's lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, later on Friday. \"It can't be taken at face value,\" he said in an interview. \"It could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.\"But Mr. McGahn had no motive to lie, according to Mr. Mueller, and he rebutted Mr. Giuliani through his own lawyer. \"It's a mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to relitigate incidents the attorney general and deputy attorney general have concluded were not obstruction,\" said the lawyer, William A. Burck. \"But they are accurately described in the report.\"On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidates condemned the president's conduct and called for action against him.\"The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,\" , who is seeking the Democratic nomination. \"That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States.\"In an era of deep polarization, Mr. Mueller's 448-page report quickly became yet another case study in the disparate realities of American politics as each camp interpreted it through its own lens and sought to weaponize it against the other side.The president's defenders insisted he was cleared because even though Mr. Mueller confirmed a wide-ranging Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 election on Mr. Trump's behalf, the special counsel established no criminal conspiracy with his campaign and opted not to decide whether to accuse the president of obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump's critics called it a devastating indictment of a candidate willing to profit from the help of a foreign power and a president who repeatedly sought to disrupt or end the investigation even if he was not charged with violating the law.[]Few Republicans expressed concern about Mr. Mueller's findings, with most lawmakers out of town for the spring recess studiously avoiding comment. One of the exceptions was Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who said he was \"appalled\" that the president's campaign welcomed help from Russia.\"I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the president,\" . \"Reading the report,\" he added, \"is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders.\"Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said the report \"documents a number of actions taken by the president or his associates that were inappropriate,\" but pointed to the conclusion by Attorney General William P. Barr and his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, that the evidence did not warrant charging Mr. Trump.More typical among Republicans was the reaction of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been working closely with the White House on the crisis in Venezuela. \"We should ALL be alarmed at how effective Putin was & we should ALL be relieved, not disappointed, that President didn't collaborate with him,\" . issued on Friday by Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, escalated a fight with Mr. Barr over what material Congress is entitled to see from the investigation even as Democrats continued to pummel the attorney general for .Mr. Nadler asked for all evidence obtained by Mr. Mueller's investigators, including summaries of witness interviews and classified intelligence -- and indicated that he intended to air it to the public.\"Even the redacted version of the report outlines serious instances of wrongdoing by President Trump and some of his closest associates,\" Mr. Nadler said in a statement. \"It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of that alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward.\"The Justice Department dismissed the subpoena, saying that Mr. Barr had made \"only minimal redactions\" and offered to allow congressional leaders to view a version with even fewer deletions.\"In light of this, Congressman Nadler's subpoena is premature and unnecessary,\" said Kerri Kupec, a department spokeswoman. \"The department will continue to work with Congress to accommodate its legitimate requests consistent with the law and long-recognized executive branch interests.\"Mr. Barr redacted about 10 percent of the report, blacking out information that would divulge secret grand jury evidence, expose classified intelligence, compromise continuing investigations, or invade the privacy or damage the reputation of \"peripheral third parties.\" Democratic leaders on Friday rejected Mr. Barr's offer to show just select leaders a version with only the grand jury material redacted.[]Mr. Nadler's May 1 deadline falls a day before Mr. Barr is scheduled to testify publicly before the Judiciary Committee in what is expected to be an explosive session in which Democrats plan to excoriate his handling of the report and Republicans will urge their colleagues to accept that there was no criminality and move on.In addition to Mr. Barr's testimony and an outstanding invitation for Mr. Mueller, Mr. Nadler said on Friday that he would hold additional hearings to \"get to the bottom of this\" and \"educate the country as to what went on.\"\"The idea is not to decide whether to debate articles of impeachment -- we may get to that point,\" Mr. Nadler said in . \"The idea is to find out exactly what went on, who did what, what institutional safeguards were gotten around and how, and then decide what to do about it.\"Mr. Nadler's Republican counterpart on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, blasted the subpoena as going \"wildly overbroad\" and encouraged Mr. Nadler to narrow its terms and extend the response time. As written, he said, Mr. Nadler's subpoena was demanding \"millions of records that would be plainly against the law to share\" because of investigators' extensive use of a grand jury.\"The attorney general offered up a 400-page report that he wasn't bound to provide,\" Mr. Collins said. \"The attorney general stands ready to testify before our committee and to have the special counsel do the same. Yet Chairman Nadler disregards all of this good-faith transparency without even taking the department up on its offer to review material under the redactions.\"Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has publicly opposed impeachment unless Democrats can attract bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, where 20 Republicans would be needed to achieve the two-thirds vote required for conviction.Ms. Pelosi has scheduled a conference call for all House Democrats on Monday to discuss what she called \"a grave matter.\" Speaking to reporters in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where she was meeting with political leaders on Friday morning, Ms. Pelosi said she would not, as a matter of principle, criticize the president while out of the country.But she signaled that Congress would not sit by. \"We believe that Article I, the legislative branch, has the responsibility of oversight of our democracy, and we will exercise that,\" she said.She faces a restive liberal base that is pressing her to go further and open a formal impeachment inquiry.\"Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the closely watched New York freshman, . \"But,\" she added, \"the report squarely puts this on our doorstep.\"Other Democrats were more reticent, arguing that the party was better off litigating the future on the campaign trail.\"We should certainly see the entire, unredacted report,\" said Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. \"But if we spend the next six months obsessed with this alone, instead of job training, health care and infrastructure, that would be a big mistake.\""},

Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, praised President Trump last spring for backing the rule of law and commended the Constitution and American culture for protecting lawfulness. \"I don't think there's any threat to the rule of law in America today,\" he said at a .Mr. Rosenstein left unmentioned that he and other senior leaders at the department and the F.B.I. were enduring Mr. Trump's sustained attacks on law enforcement in both public and private. The president had demanded Mr. Rosenstein falsely claim responsibility for dismissing the bureau's director and had toyed with firing the attorney general, prompting Mr. Rosenstein and the Justice Department's No. 3 official to vow to quit if the termination happened.The long-awaited report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, released on Thursday painted a portrait of law enforcement leaders more fiercely under siege than previously known. They struggled to navigate Mr. Trump's apparent disregard for their mission through a mix of threats to resign, quiet defiance and capitulation to some presidential demands. While their willingness to stay quiet might have protected their institutions, it also helped empower Mr. Trump to continue his attacks.Mr. Trump made good on some threats, the day after the midterm elections in November. The third-ranking Justice Department official, Rachel Brand, left three months before Mr. Rosenstein's speech to become Walmart's top lawyer. Mr. Rosenstein, who had an inside look at the investigation as its overseer and at Mr. Trump's behavior as a top political appointee, .\"The bad news is that the attacks were relentless, but the good news is that the department has a thin political layer and a strong tradition of professionalism,\" said Chuck Rosenberg, a former chief of staff to the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump, James B. Comey. \"But to see it and to read about the president's behavior is deeply disturbing.\"The president sought to undermine the Justice Department's leaders and thwart the Russia investigation from his first days in office.He demanded that Mr. Comey publicly say that he was not under investigation, and he asked Dana J. Boente, who was briefly the acting attorney general before Mr. Sessions was confirmed in February 2017, to let him know whether the F.B.I. was investigating the White House, according to the special counsel's report.His attacks on law enforcement were most vividly embodied in his treatment of Mr. Sessions, who was himself investigated by the F.B.I. over whether he lied about contacts he had with Russian officials during the election, the report said.Mr. Sessions, a top 2016 Trump campaign supporter, recused himself early into his tenure from election-related investigations, drawing Mr. Trump's ire. After the , the president demanded Mr. Sessions's resignation, saying he wanted an attorney general who would harness the Justice Department's power to protect the presidency.Mr. Sessions submitted his resignation, touching off a scramble among White House aides to keep the president from accepting it. While he let Mr. Sessions keep his job, Mr. Trump pocketed his resignation letter and set off fears within the White House that he would wield it to get what he wanted from law enforcement officials.Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff, told Mr. Sessions that the president could use the letter as a kind of \"shock collar,\" according to the report, and he told Mr. Trump that he had \"D.O.J. by the throat.\" It took Mr. Priebus two weeks to get the president to hand over the letter.Seeking a loyal attorney general, Mr. Trump asked a White House aide about Ms. Brand, a George W. Bush administration veteran. Was she \"on the team,\" and could he gauge her appetite for overseeing the Mueller inquiry or even becoming the attorney general?But the aide never reached out to Ms. Brand \"because he was sensitive to the implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an effort to end the investigation or fire the special counsel,\" according to the report.When Mr. Trump pushed Mr. Priebus to secure Mr. Sessions's resignation, Mr. Priebus warned the president that both Mr. Rosenstein and Ms. Brand would also resign, a scenario certain to plunge the Justice Department into crisis.The president agreed to hold off on firing Mr. Sessions for a day, to prevent the Sunday morning television news shows from focusing on it, and eventually dropped his plan to oust him. Instead, he stepped up his public criticisms. The attacks became so pointed, harsh and relentless that Mr. Sessions prepared another resignation letter and carried it with him whenever he went to the White House, according to the report.\"Attorney General Sessions carrying a resignation letter with him each time he had a meeting at the White House is a vivid reflection of the dysfunctional and unprecedented approach this president has taken towards the Department of Justice and federal law enforcement,\" said Matthew S. Axelrod, a partner at Linklaters and a former Justice Department official and prosecutor under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama.Mr. Sessions resisted multiple entreaties to reverse his recusal so he could oversee and curtail the Mueller inquiry; by the time the criminal investigation of him ended in March 2018, he could do little to get back in the president's graces.Mr. Rosenstein, whose office received briefings every other week on the progress of the investigation, would have glimpsed the gravity of the situation as the special counsel interviewed witnesses.He was also in the unusual position of being a witness himself in the investigation that he oversaw. Critics have said that role should have prompted Mr. Rosenstein to recuse himself from the inquiry, but top ethics lawyers at the Justice Department cleared him to oversee the special counsel, a department spokeswoman said. She added that the special counsel's office never asked about or questioned that decision.After Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey as the director of the F.B.I., setting off a storm of criticism, he asked Mr. Rosenstein to give a news conference and say that the firing had been his idea.Mr. Rosenstein warned the president that the news conference was a bad idea \",\" Mr. Mueller's investigators wrote. Mr. Sessions told White House lawyers that Mr. Rosenstein was upset about being used as a pretext for the ouster, and both officials told Donald F. McGahn II, then the White House counsel, that Mr. Trump was spinning a false narrative about Mr. Rosenstein's role in the termination.Mr. Rosenstein proved to be deeply rattled during the chaotic days after Mr. Comey's firing. He discussed the possibility of to remove Mr. Trump as president and suggested that he secretly record Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, according to people briefed on the events. Mr. Rosenstein has denied their accounts.When those revelations surfaced in news reports more than a year later, in September 2018, Mr. Rosenstein braced himself to be fired. But after meeting with Mr. Trump and his aides, Mr. Rosenstein and oversaw the Mueller investigation through the end.In February, he once again complimented Mr. Trump in about the rule of law.\"I'm very confident that when we look back in the long run on this era of the Department of Justice,\" he said, \"the president will deserve credit for the folks that he appointed to run the department.\"Attorney General William P. Barr, who took office that month, appears to be trying to reset the relationship between the White House and the Justice Department. He has helped further the president's agenda on and , and he has vowed to investigate whether the Russia investigation was tainted by what he called unlawful \".\"He also worked to offset the Mueller report's damning portrait of Mr. Trump. On Thursday, just before the report's release, Mr. Barr held a news conference in which he offered a striking defense of Mr. Trump, highlighting facts to help build a case for exoneration and avoiding assertions that were more damaging for the president.\"There was relentless speculation in the news media about the president's personal culpability,\" Mr. Barr told reporters. \"Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.\""},

Even then, with the help of his lawyers, the president found it difficult to summon details from his presidential campaign in 2016 that might shed light on what happened.More than 30 times, he that he had no memory of what they were asking about, employing several formulations to make the same point.\"I do not remember.\"\"I do not recall.\"\"I have no recollection.\"\"I have no independent recollection.\"\"I have no current recollection.\"He did not remember learning about a held in June 2016 by his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman with visiting Russians promising \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. He did not remember being told in advance of Russian hacking of Democratic emails before the stolen messages were posted online.He did not remember any particular conversations with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser, during the last months of the campaign, much less discussions with him about WikiLeaks. He did not remember discussing a possible trip to Russia to promote a proposed tower project in Moscow. He did not remember an invitation from Russia's deputy prime minister to attend an economic forum in St. Petersburg.A fuzzy memory is not exactly unusual for any president given how much they typically juggle, much less a 72-year-old president who is the oldest ever elected for the first time. But Mr. Mueller's prosecutors considered his memory lapses unsatisfying and pressed Mr. Trump's lawyer again for an in-person interview, to no avail.\"The written responses, we informed counsel, 'demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask follow-up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client's recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection,'\" said.Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's private lawyers, defended his client's answers on Friday. \"The president responded to the questions,\" he said. \"They are answers, not speculations.\"Mr. Trump rarely lacks for certainty in his public statements on camera, but has shown more caution when under oath.He said, \"I don't remember\" in a lawsuit involving his now-defunct Trump University and related to the university suit three years later, not counting 10 more times in the two interviews that he said, \"I don't recall\" or \"Can't remember.\" (He eventually for $25 million.)Prosecutors said such selective memory tended to make them suspicious.\"It's always a red flag when a witness appears to selectively forget the events most likely to be damning,\" said Dwight C. Holton, who spent 14 years as a prosecutor, most recently as United States attorney in Oregon.\"And when you have a witness who repeatedly and publicly thumps his chest about how great his memory is, then all of a sudden he has sudden massive memory loss -- well, let's just say that's a target I'd like to cross-examine in front of a jury.\"Barbara L. McQuade, a former United States attorney in Michigan, said the president's answers \"demonstrate why written answers are a poor substitute for an in-person interview.\"During a face-to-face encounter, she said, prosecutors can refresh a witness's memory by providing additional details or showing him documents. They can also come to a judgment based on body language.\"I have not dealt with a witness who has claimed not to remember facts as many times as Trump did, but it is impossible to read a witness's mind to know whether he is telling the truth,\" she said. \"Trump's refusal to participate in an interview,\" she added, \"hampered Mueller's investigation and contradicts\" the assertion by Attorney General William P. Barr that the president had cooperated fully.But it may have saved him from a worse outcome. Mr. Mueller began asking Mr. Trump for an interview in December 2017 only to be put off for months. The president's lawyers opposed the idea, worried that Mr. Trump, who has a documented history of making untrue assertions publicly, would testify falsely and walk into what they deemed a perjury trap.Bowing to the demands of the president's lawyers, Mr. Mueller agreed to submit written questions, and only about contacts with Russia before Mr. Trump took office, not about potential obstruction of justice once he entered the White House. When , they were so \"incomplete or imprecise,\" the report said, that Mr. Mueller complained to the president's legal team about \"the insufficiency of those responses.\"The answers Mr. Trump provided sounded more like lawyer speak than the blunt-talking president's usual colorful language. They included phrases like \"named entities or individuals\" and \"tangible support\" and \"no meaningful relationship.\"It may be hard to imagine Mr. Trump saying or writing this: \"In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the campaign documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution and sources of information for the speech I expected to give 'probably' on the Monday following my June 7, 2016, comments.\"But if his memory were hazy in many cases, it was crystal clear in at least one instance. Asked about a specific date that June, Mr. Trump noted that he had prevailed in Republican nomination contests in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana and South Dakota that day. \"I remember winning those primaries,\" he wrote.After Mr. Mueller pressed again for an in-person interview in December, Mr. Trump's lawyers refused again. The special counsel opted not to seek a subpoena to force the president to talk, unlike Ken Starr, the independent counsel who in 1998 subpoenaed President Bill Clinton and withdrew the order only after the president's legal team .Mr. Mueller said he had chosen not to press the issue because he had already \"made significant progress\" and a court fight to enforce a subpoena against a sitting president, even if successful, could prolong the investigation. \"We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation,\" the report said, \"against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report.\"Critics of Mr. Trump have questioned that decision, saying the special counsel should have held out for a formal interview. As it happened, by sticking to carefully scripted written answers, the president avoided any charge that he had misled investigators.That is an outcome neither he nor Mr. Mueller is likely to forget."},

Not Trump's.", "authors": "Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman", "contents": "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- After admitting to investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that she delivered a false statement from the White House podium, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended herself in Trumpian fashion on Friday morning. She counterattacked. revealed that Ms. Sanders had acknowledged that her repeated claim in 2017 that she had personally communicated with \"countless\" F.B.I. officials who told her they were happy with President Trump's decision to fire James B. Comey as the agency's director was a \"slip of the tongue\" and not founded on any facts.Asked on \"Good Morning America\" if the report had damaged her credibility, Ms. Sanders responded that she had made the statement in the heat of the moment, and that it was not \"a scripted talking point.\"But then she added, \"I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot like the Democrat Party that went out for two and a half years and repeated time and time again that there was definitely Russian collusion between the president and his campaign.\"It has been a hallmark of the Trump White House never to admit a mistake, never to apologize and never to cede a point. This case was no different. \"The White House staff will never be lectured on truth-telling from the media that pushed a flat-out lie about Donald Trump for two years,\" Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in an email.Ms. Sanders, who has often taken news media outlets to task for what they write and report and has accused them of spreading \"fake news\" about Mr. Trump, was just a footnote in Mr. Mueller's 448-page report. But because of her public role, the anecdote involving her false statement loomed large in the broader portrait by the special counsel of a White House .And it remains to be seen how the incident and Ms. Sanders's response will affect her credibility with reporters, with whom she has had fewer interactions than many of her predecessors since the White House quietly phased out the daily press briefing over the past nine months.More often, Ms. Sanders speaks for the president on friendly programs like \"Fox & Friends.\" She has also come to view her role as a person who defends her colleagues and the president, rather than someone who delivers a message to the press about the work that is underway at the White House.Some of Mr. Trump's aides and allies acknowledged on Friday that it was problematic for the president's chief spokeswoman to spend airtime defending her own credibility. But White House officials -- some of whom think Ms. Sanders is taking an unfair beating in the press -- do not expect Mr. Trump to be fazed by the controversy. Unlike previous administrations, in which officials feared blows to their credibility in public, Mr. Trump's press aides are generally performing for an audience of one -- the president.For months, Ms. Sanders, who declined to comment, has toyed with the idea of moving on from a position she has held for almost two years as part of a White House press and communications team that has often seemed dysfunctional.The job of communications director has remained vacant since Bill Shine, the fifth person to hold the position, . Along with Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, and Mercedes Schlapp, a top communications adviser, Ms. Sanders is now viewed internally as part of a three-headed messaging operation, and it is not clear who is really in charge, other than Mr. Trump.Ms. Sanders's predecessor, Sean Spicer, suffered his own reputational damage on Day 1 of the administration, when Mr. Trump ordered him to falsely tell reporters that the crowd at his inauguration was \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" Mr. Spicer has since said he regretted that comment and his belligerent appearance in the briefing room that day, which also enraged the president.But for now, Ms. Sanders is not willing to admit any misstep.In an interview with Fox News on Thursday night, she told Sean Hannity that \"I acknowledged that I had a slip of the tongue when I used the word 'countless,' but it's not untrue\" because her broader point was that \"a number of both current and former F.B.I. agents agreed with the president.\"In her interview with George Stephanopoulos on \"Good Morning America,\" he also grilled her about her false statement that Mr. Trump did not dictate the administration's statement on a meeting that his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took with a Russian operative at Trump Tower in June 2016. Mr. Mueller's report revealed that the president's lawyers acknowledged that he did, in fact, dictate the statement that was released.\"I'm not denying that he had involvement in what the statement said,\" Ms. Sanders said on Friday. \"That was the information I was given at the time.\"In previous administrations, when it was revealed that press secretaries had delivered false statements from the White House podium, there was more of a reaction and often some soul-searching.\"She is in a credibility bind that in most White Houses would be disqualifying, but probably not in this one,\" said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"No matter how honorable you were coming in, when you sign up as the spokesman for someone who habitually lies, you, by necessity, become a habitual liar.\"In 2003, Scott McClellan, President George W. Bush's press secretary, told reporters that two senior administration officials, Karl Rove and I. Lewis Libby Jr., were \"not involved\" in a leak about Valerie Plame, the C.I.A. operative.Later, in his memoir, Mr. McClellan delivered a mea culpa, admitting that he had been given false information to disseminate to the press. \"I had unknowingly passed along false information,\" Mr. McClellan wrote, adding that five of the highest-ranking White House officials, including the president, had misinformed him.Others have survived accusations that they lied. In 1983, Larry Speakes, a press aide to President Ronald Reagan, told reporters that the notion that the United States would invade Grenada was \"preposterous.\" The invasion took place the next day, and Mr. Speakes said he learned of it belatedly.Jay Carney, Mr. Obama's press secretary, took heat for helping to propagate the president's message on the Affordable Care Act that \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\" after it became clear that the administration was unable to deliver on the promise.But for veteran aides of the Trump White House, the furor over Ms. Sanders's remark has only added to a bunker mentality shared by aides who feel they are constantly defending themselves, and the president, from unfair attacks.And on the president's favorite show, Ms. Sanders had the last word. \"James Comey was a disgraced leaker who tried to politicize and undermine the very agency he was supposed to run,\" she told Mr. Hannity. \"Firing James Comey remains one of the best decisions that the president made.\""},

Schmidt, Maggie Haberman", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump's lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, attacked the credibility of a former White House counsel on Friday, saying his account of how Mr. Trump told him to remove the special counsel was inaccurate.Mr. Giuliani's statement was the most extensive pushback by the president's lawyers against the former counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who cooperated extensively with the special counsel's investigators. The , released on Thursday, also included several damning examples of how Mr. Trump tried to interfere with the investigation, like Mr. McGahn's account.\"It can't be taken at face value,\" Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. \"It could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.\"Mr. McGahn's lawyer, William A. Burck, pushed back on Mr. Giuliani's attack.\"It's a mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to relitigate incidents the attorney general and deputy attorney general have concluded were not obstruction,\" Mr. Burck said. \"But they are accurately described in the report.\"The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, examined a wide range of actions that Mr. Trump took as president that could be considered obstruction of justice. Investigators relied heavily on Mr. McGahn, who provided detailed accounts of what Mr. Trump did and said behind closed doors as he tried to maintain control over the Russia investigation.Among the damaging episodes was one based largely on Mr. McGahn that laid out how Mr. Trump told him in June 2017 to have Mr. Mueller ousted because he had several conflict of interest issues. Mr. McGahn believed the conflicts had little merit and told senior White House officials that he was going to resign instead of carrying out Mr. Trump's order.Mr. Giuliani said that the president never asked Mr. McGahn to have Mr. Mueller removed, adding that Mr. Trump was simply venting about his frustrations with the special counsel's investigation, which had cast a cloud over his presidency.\"If it were subject to cross-examination or analysis, it would be a different version,\" Mr. Giuliani said.On the day Mr. McGahn threatened to quit, Mr. Burck told him to hold back on telling other White House officials about what the president was asking him to do. Mr. Burck wanted to stop Mr. McGahn from roping other White House officials into the obstruction of justice investigation and from creating the impression that Mr. McGahn was willing to help Mr. Trump oust Mr. Mueller.Because Mr. McGahn mainly discussed the issue with Mr. Burck, there are not many witnesses to back him up. In an effort to substantiate Mr. McGahn's credibility, Mr. Mueller's team obtained Mr. McGahn's phone records from the episode. Although Mr. McGahn told investigators that there were two conversations he had with Mr. Trump, the records show only one call, according the report.\"While McGahn was not certain of the specific dates of the calls,\" the report said, \"McGahn was confident that he had at least two phone conversations with the president in which the president directed him to call the acting attorney general to have the special counsel removed.\"The report said that investigators accepted Mr. McGahn's account because he was \"a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.\"In attacking Mr. McGahn, Mr. Giuliani went further than the president had earlier Friday, when he walked up to the line of calling Mr. McGahn out on Twitter. that \"statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by 18 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated & totally untrue.\"\"Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed,\" the president tweeted."},

Herndon, Matt Flegenheimer", "contents": "COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa -- As Peter Johnson and Emily Neal waited for Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to arrive at Barley's, a brick-lined sports bar in southwestern Iowa, they gamed out possible nominees in the Democratic presidential primary.Mr. Johnson, a 27-year-old law student, said the large field was a great equalizer, and \"if at the end of it we get an old white guy, someone who represents the status quo, it'll be because they've proven themselves.\"Ms. Neal, a dental hygienist, made an agonized face at Mr. Johnson, her boyfriend. Wouldn't something be lost, she asked, if the historically diverse slate of 2020 Democrats was passed over?\"Personally I'd love to see a woman,\" Ms. Neal, also 27, said at the event on Thursday night. \"If people are being catty and holding gender or race against a candidate, it would break my heart.\"As former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the 2020 race this coming week, Democrats have seen the strong diversity in their field -- with candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris reflecting the and largely base of the party -- become somewhat overshadowed by white male candidates. Bernie Sanders has , he and Mr. Biden lead in , and Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg have enjoyed outsize from in early primary states, extensive media coverage and viral success with online donors.Interviews with several dozen Democratic voters around the country show how the party, which enjoyed victories in 2018 that were powered by female and nonwhite candidates, is now grappling with two complicated questions about race, gender and politics in the Trump era.Is a white male the best face for an increasingly diverse Democratic Party in 2020? And what's the bigger gamble: to nominate a white man and risk disappointing some of the party's base, or nominate a minority candidate or a woman who might struggle to carry predominantly white swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that both Barack Obama and Mr. Trump won?Pam Van Arsdale, 64, of Bedford, N.H., said she would like to see a minority or female candidate catch fire, and worries that nominating a white man could cause some liberals to skip voting in November 2020.\"I consider myself a centrist, middle-of-the-road Democrat. And the progressive side worries me. What are they going to do? Are they going to sit it out if they don't like the top candidate?\" she said while attending a recent event for .But Lee Kujawa, 72, of Wauwatosa, Wis., near Milwaukee, made a case for Mr. Biden, seeing him as \"the most electable.\"\"He can stand up to Trump,\" said Mr. Kujawa, who said he believed the party would not pay a penalty by nominating its first white male nominee since John Kerry in 2004. Referring to Mr. Biden, he said, \"He could pick Kamala Harris as a running mate; she's one of my top three favorites.\"[]White men have largely ruled both the Democratic and Republican parties throughout American history, even as they have declined to roughly 30 percent of the population, and many voters still have preconceptions of presidents as white and male. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are starting off with other advantages as well: They are the best-known candidates at this stage, both with experience running for president, and they are well positioned to have the money and resources to compete through the 2020 primaries.But as older white men, they are out of step with ascendant forces in the party today.Women, minorities and young people are fueling much of its energy, and they are well represented by multiple well-qualified, politically savvy female and nonwhite Democrats who are running. Ms. Harris in particular has had , and only Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders consistently outpace her in polls.The party also has a new primary calendar for 2020 that could help these candidates: The diverse Democratic electorates in California and Texas will vote earlier than usual, and candidates like Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker could also benefit from in the early primary state of South Carolina.Many of the voters interviewed said that the most important qualification was the ability to defeat Mr. Trump, who has come away from the recent release of the Mueller report more angry than elated and wants a political victory untainted by questions of legitimacy. To some, the best Democratic candidate will be one who can wrest voters who backed Mr. Trump in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as Democrats did somewhat successfully in 2018 to flip the House.Jason Pinkowski, 35, who lives in the Milwaukee suburbs, crossed off several Democrats -- Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders because they are too old, and Mr. O'Rourke because he is too young -- to arrive at Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris as his current favorites.\"Long story short, if a Democrat decides to put time in the Midwest, I think he or she will have a good chance,\" he said.The presumption that Democrats will turn out in force to beat Mr. Trump, no matter who the nominee is, has hurt the party before. Hillary Clinton, her campaign strategy, the news media and the F.B.I. have all been blamed for her loss. For whatever reason, she lost votes in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 compared to Mr. Obama in 2012, including a notable falloff among black voters.Mr. Trump, in turn, energized the Republican base, which appears to remain loyal to him for the most part, and also won over some Midwest voters who once backed Mr. Obama.David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the key to threading the electoral needle in 2020 was a diverse presidential ticket able to stop the hemorrhaging of white rural voters and to excite minority voters. He pointed to Senator Sherrod Brown's success in Ohio in appealing to both electorates in his 2018 re-election in a state that otherwise voted for Republicans in statewide campaigns.\"If between the ticket you have someone who's got that economic populist brand of a Sherrod Brown, but also the diversity that will energize Cuyahoga County so that you have a margin of 200,000-plus versus 150,000, I think you win Ohio and all the rest of those Midwest states,\" Mr. Pepper said. He was referring to the Democrat-rich county dominated by the predominantly black city of Cleveland. (To be sure, Mr. Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016.)[]Others see the focus on electability as too limited -- and even as an underhanded way to discount black and female candidates.For this group, which includes voters and several political observers who focus on race and gender, there is a particular annoyance around code words they feel unduly penalize candidates. Questions about which contender is \"electable\" and who can \"bring the country together\" distract from areas where female and minority candidates may lead the pack, including policy proposals and who best energizes typical nonvoters.Compounding these frustrations have been Ms. Warren's campaign fund-raising struggles and the early buzz around candidates like Mr. O'Rourke, who himself has acknowledged that he benefits from white male privilege.\"Bringing the country together won't happen right now, so just vote for the best progressive policy,\" said Kyrsten Matthews, 29, who attended Ms. Warren's Birmingham, Ala., rally. \"I know that's what I'm going to do.\"For some voters interviewed during Ms. Warren's , which included stops in heavily black communities in Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, there was interest in candidates such as Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Sanders or Mr. Biden because of factors unrelated to identity.In Selma, Ala., Roderick West, 62, said he was looking to support Mr. Biden because of his experience as vice president. Supporters of Mr. Sanders say his calls for wide-scale change in the country's economic order make him a transformational candidate, regardless of skin color. And some admirers of Mr. Buttigieg say that, as a gay man, he brings diversity to the field and would be a history-making nominee.In conversations across eastern Iowa, Democratic voters acknowledged a feeling of whiplash after a midterm campaign defined largely by the success of women and people of color. Many of those interviewed seemed almost resigned to having a white male nominee, reserving their angst for what they view as a greater priority than diversity atop the Democratic ticket: defeating Mr. Trump.\"It's important to appeal to Republicans. I don't know if a minority candidate can do that,\" Catherine Rohret, who will turn 18 in June, said moments after watching Mr. O'Rourke campaign in Waterloo, Iowa. \"It hurts me to say because I'm a black woman. I would love to see a woman candidate.\"Rachel Cox, 35, from Iowa City, seemed exultant despite frigid temperatures moments after meeting Mr. O'Rourke at a St. Patrick's Day 5K in North Liberty, Iowa. A former Texan who waited until after the 2018 midterms to switch her registration to Iowa -- so she could vote for Mr. O'Rourke -- Ms. Cox said that a white male candidate might be better positioned to build a winning coalition.\"There could be two sides to that story,\" she said when asked if nominating another white man could depress turnout in some corners of the party. \"Beto could bring a lot of moderate Republicans who are maybe a little bit averse to voting for women or voting for minorities.\"Ms. Cox had good reason to be concerned about the role of discrimination in voter choices. In several instances during Ms. Warren's Southern tour, men who attended an event with the Massachusetts senator dismissed supporting her candidacy using sexist terminology.\"Trump will run over a woman,\" Carl West, 64, said as he walked to see Ms. Warren at the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. \"He'll just run a woman into the ground.\"Diane Henning, 70, a retired bookkeeper outside of Milwaukee, disagreed sharply. She said it would be a mistake for Democrats to nominate a white man in 2020.\"There are so many good women out there who could do the job,\" she said. \"I think women are a lot more open-minded, we certainly have been all of these years.\"For Hannah Reid, 22, who is a graduating senior at the University of Tampa and heard Mr. Buttigieg at an event recently, her decision making on a Democratic candidate will go beyond identity.\"I am a woman of color, but that's not all that I am,\" said Ms. Reid, who is black. Referring to Mr. Buttigieg, she said: \"He's in the L.G.B.T. community, which is something we've never seen before. It's got to be about more than just who you are; it's got to be about what you think and what you say, what your ideas are.\""},

Instead, a guard at the cathedral first had to climb a steep set of stairs to the attic -- a trip Mr. Mouton said would take a \"fit\" person six minutes.Only after a blaze was discovered could the fire department be notified and deployed. That means even a flawless response had a built-in delay of about 20 minutes -- from the moment the alarm sounded until firefighters could arrive and climb to the attic with hundreds of pounds of hoses and equipment to begin battling a fire.Those delays turned out to be devastating.\"I was stunned by the speed with which the oak in Notre-Dame burned,\" Mr. Mouton said. \"Oak that old can't burn like a match. It's absolutely incomprehensible.\"But fire safety experts said that Mr. Mouton and his team underestimated the risk -- and that the fire response they designed was far too slow to fight a blaze in time.\"It doesn't make any sense,\" said Jonathan Barnett, a fire safety authority at Basic Expert in Australia. \"Twenty minutes is a huge delay before you get people involved. Once that heavy timber starts to burn, you can't put it out. So I have no idea why they built in this delay.\"Guards responding to a fire alarm at Notre-Dame had to climb a steep set of stairs and check for a fire before they could notify the fire department.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.By Evan Grothjan, Karthik Patanjali and Elian PeltierFrancois Chatillon, a senior architect involved in numerous restorations of France's historic monuments, also stressed that the intense fire risk in the oak timbers underneath Notre-Dame's lead roof was well known.Once lit, he said, \"It is like throwing a match in a matchbox, it's impossible to put out.\"For him the surprise was not that Notre-Dame burned this week, but \"that it didn't burn before.\"Mr. Mouton and his team were not solely responsible for all the decisions made to secure a monument as precious as Notre-Dame. At a minimum, their plans required approval up the chain at the Culture Ministry.Charlotte Hubert, who presides at the same group of chief architects in charge of historical monuments that Mr. Mouton belongs to, underscored that security at such buildings was tightly regulated.\"The chief architect isn't handed the keys and left to do exactly as he wants,\" Ms. Hubert said.Still, fire experts said that two of the top officials on the project, Mr. Mouton and a former firefighter, Lt. Col. Regis Prunet, appeared to have miscalculated what was needed to protect such an unusual, complex and irreplaceable building from a fire.Scientists consulted by The New York Times said fire dynamics indicated that, while the dense timbers may take time to burn completely, a fire would naturally race across the original timbers at Notre-Dame. It was a mistake to assume otherwise, they said.Mr. Mouton was the architect in charge of Notre-Dame between 2000 and 2013, and in that position he oversaw a revamp of fire safety.\"The issue of fire safety was brought up as soon as I arrived,\" he said. \"I managed the issue from beginning to end.\"Mr. Prunet, the former firefighter, became fire safety adviser at the Culture Ministry and worked with Mr. Mouton and his team.The two men faced a monumental task. There was no proper fire protection plan in place, not even a plan to evacuate tourists or worshipers in case of a blaze, Mr. Prunet said in a separate interview. It was a miracle that nothing had happened before, he said, and \"a great irony\" that it should happen so soon after a plan was put in place.Both Mr. Mouton and Mr. Prunet said they had been given a free hand to design the most effective fire protection system. Money was not an issue.When the budget came in higher than expected, the authorities found the money and merely stretched the number of years to put the plan in place, to four from two, Mr. Mouton said.\"The project was not downsized because of financial considerations, I can absolutely guarantee that,\" he said.But even if no cost was spared, there was also a conservative approach to preserving the historic wooden structure in its unadulterated form. The designers were determined not to alter the attic with protective measures like sprinklers or fire walls.A willingness to sacrifice its pristine state for a compromise between what was possible 850 years ago and what is sensible today could have saved the spire, experts said.Firewall technology was used elsewhere in the cathedral -- but not in the attic. Mr. Prunet said the scale and complexity of the attic structure at Notre-Dame was of a different order.The cathedral was all but assured to go up in flames.\"In Notre-Dame it was very complicated because the oak beams were entangled with each other in what we call the forest,\" Mr. Prunet said.But the main reason to opt against fire walls, Mr. Mouton said, was because it risked \"mutilating\" the structure.\"It's true,\" he said, that the idea had been floated at the time, \"but it was discarded.\"\"It changes the appearance but also the elements, because to put up a partition you need to cut the wood. It's mutilating,\" Mr. Mouton said.Mr. Prunet added that sprinklers were not added because they would \"drown the whole structure.\"Instead, they said, the team had banked on prevention and detection. This was a conscious choice.Two guards were on site to monitor the delicate roof structure, day and night, like a bank vault. The cathedral was covered in smoke and heat sensors. Three times a day someone went up to check that the system was working.Mr. Mouton said he performed a trial of the time it took for a guard to investigate an alert, racing one of his guards to the top of the attic.''It does take a certain amount of time, including for someone who is very fit,\" he said. \"That solution seemed reasonable to me, considering that it's old oak and doesn't burn like that.\"Beyond that assumption, the alert system appears to have been flawed, too, beginning with the response to the first alarm at 6:20 p.m.The guard, seeing no obvious fire, gave the all-clear and came down.But when an alarm goes off, it is imperative to identify which alarm it was -- and why -- including whether a malfunction or an insect crawled into the apparatus, said Glenn Corbett, an associate professor of fire science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\"There wasn't an adequate investigation of that first alarm,\" Mr. Corbett said. \"That was probably the biggest mistake they made.\"At that point, presumably, a smoldering fire somewhere in the attic had begun to spread, though how the fire started has yet to be determined.Fire safety experts struggled to understand how Mr. Mouton came to believe that fire would spread slowly in old hardwood.Mr. Corbett said that in long-discredited lore, fires in heavy timber buildings dating to the 19th century were sometimes referred to as \"slow burning.\"Mr. Barnett, the Australian expert, underscored that the time it takes a fire to burn a piece of thick timber completely is entirely different from calculating how quickly a fire will spread.\"He miscalculated the large surface area,\" Mr. Barnett said. \"There's lots of energy and it's spreading very quickly.\"By the time the second alarm sounded at 6:43 p.m. and a guard climbed the stairs again, the fire was already a conflagration.The call finally went to the fire brigade at 6:51 p.m.\"We could have avoided all this with a modern detection system,\" said Guillaume Poitrinal, president of Fondation du Patrimoine, an organization that promotes French architectural heritage.The early detection technology was an aspirating smoke detection system provided by Siemens in 2013, but the company said it had not been given a service contract and could not speak to possible operational questions.Fire alarms in France never automatically alert the fire department, a spokesman for the Paris Fire Brigade confirmed.\"There can be false alarms, that's why the firefighters ask that someone go check,\" said Gabriel Plus, the spokesman. He called this \"removal of doubt.\"But outside experts suggested that in the case of Notre-Dame, the choices in the fire safety design did not leave enough time for that.There would have been one other solution: A permanent presence of firefighters on site. Buildings that run \"a significant risk\" in case of a fire, Mr. Plus said, sometimes get such a presence, among them the Louvre, the Paris court, the National Assembly and the National Library.Notre Dame, he said, was not in this category.Mr. Mouton acknowledged that firefighters on standby would have been the only reliable way to ensure against fire damage, but he said this would not have been justified when \"there are fires going off everywhere in Paris and in the suburbs.\"Some risk had to be accepted, he said. \"All things are relative.\"\"I am very troubled by what has happened,\" Mr. Mouton said.Would he design the system differently today, knowing what he knows now?\"The detection system would have been the same,\" he said, \"but the response system would have changed.\"\"Of course it's the first minutes that count,\" he said, pausing. Then he added: \"After the fact, one is always wrong and could have done better.\""},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/nyregion/tallest-buildings-manhattan-loophole.html", "title": "How Luxury Developers Use a Loophole to Build Soaring Towers for the Ultrarich in N.Y.", "authors": "Matthew Haag", "contents": "Some of the tallest residential buildings in the world soar above Central Park, including 432 Park Avenue, which rises 1,400 feet and features an array of penthouses and apartments for the ultrarich.But 432 Park also has an increasingly common feature in these new towers: swaths of unoccupied space. About a quarter of its 88 floors will have no homes because they are filled with structural and mechanical equipment.The building and nearby towers are able to push high into the sky because of a loophole in the city's labyrinthine zoning laws. Floors reserved for structural and mechanical equipment, no matter how much, do not count against a building's maximum size under the laws, so developers explicitly use them to make buildings far higher than would otherwise be permitted.The towers benefiting the most from the zoning quirk have all sprouted during the past half-decade: enormous glass and steel buildings with lavish condominiums that sell for millions of dollars. Many line the blocks around Central Park, some of the most expensive and coveted real estate in the city, and have become second homes for Chinese billionaires, European tycoons and out-of-state hedge fund investors.But the proliferation of these buildings is provoking a backlash amid a broader debate about affordable housing, megaprojects for the ultrarich and the city's identity. Now, officials are seeking to rein in developers by proposing rules that would apply unusually large mechanical spaces toward a building's height limit.The motivation to build tall is obvious: panoramic views for residents and hefty profits for developers. A 95th floor condominium at 432 Park Avenue sold in December for $30.7 million, or about $7,592 a square foot. That same month, a unit about halfway down the building sold for $4,216 a square foot.\"It's pretty outrageous, but it's also pretty clever,\" said George M. Janes, a planning consultant who has tracked and filed challenges against buildings in New York with vast unoccupied spaces. \"What is the primary purpose of these spaces? The primary purpose is to build very tall buildings.\"The effort by the city to curb building heights has ignited a showdown with the powerful real estate industry, which has criticized the proposed rules as overly restrictive and misguided.Harry B. Macklowe, who developed 432 Park Avenue, said he agrees with the effort to establish firm rules around mechanical spaces, but he rejected claims that his building was using them to rise higher. Every mechanical floor, he said, has equipment necessary for the building to function.\"It offends me,\" Mr. Macklowe said, \"because we created a very nice building that fits into the skyline perfectly.\"Many of these towers stay vacant most of the year, so their owners are not subject to local and state income taxes because they are not city residents. As a result, the state and city have already begun a separate crackdown on them.State lawmakers proposed a pied-a-terre tax, an annual recurring tax on second homes valued at more than $5 million, but it was derailed . Instead, a one-time fee on the sale of multimillion-dollar homes.New York City's complicated building regulations are meant to produce predictable developments. Height requirements are imposed in most of the city, though parts of Manhattan are exempt. Every block is also effectively assigned a maximum square footage, which can be spread across smaller buildings on a block or condensed in larger developments.Savvy, well-heeled and patient developers have worked that system to their benefit. A developer seeking to build a supertall tower might start with one lot on a block and then buy unused square footage from its neighbors.With advancements in engineering and construction, that developer can take the accumulated square footage and concentrate it in a skinny mega-tower. Floors of mechanical space, exempt from the square footage calculations, make the tower even taller.\"There is no question that they have become this lightning rod because they are not just luxury housing but uber-luxury housing,\" said Elizabeth Goldstein, president of the Municipal Art Society, a nonprofit group that seeks to preserve the city's architecture and urban design. She said they were unaffordable not only for the 99 percent but also for most of the 1 percent.The city's proposal aimed at supertall buildings -- which needs to be approved by the City Council -- would not eliminate enormous mechanical spaces but would penalize projects that have them.Oversized mechanical floors -- those greater than 30 feet tall, or about three times the size of a typical apartment's ceiling height -- would be counted toward the building's maximum size. The rules would largely apply to developments around Central Park and in parts of Lower Manhattan.Two other cities with skyscrapers, Chicago and Miami, have similar zoning codes but regulate mechanical floors differently.In Chicago, big empty spaces -- those greater than 5,000 square feet -- are not counted toward the tower's overall size, though officials said they knew of no complaints about developers exploiting the rule. In Miami, mechanical spaces are subtracted from the maximum size unless the area is an atrium or an open-air feature.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the proposed rules would \"stop luxury developers from gaming the system.\"\"Artificially tall mechanical spaces that serve no purpose but to boost views of top-floor apartments violate the spirit of our zoning regulations,\" Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.But the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's influential lobbying arm, said the rules were too restrictive and at odds with engineering trends, such as the future need for large spaces for batteries to support renewable energy.At a recent public hearing, engineers and architects said the proposal would drive up the cost of construction.Bart A. Sullivan, an engineer in New York who has worked on high rises around the world, said supertall skyscrapers need large unoccupied floors for complex mechanical and structural equipment, including elevator motors, heating, ventilation and air conditioning.Developers, he said, could work within the proposed restrictions but would have to spend more on structural features.\"Most anything is possible if you throw enough money at it, but these projects have to make sense from an economic point of view,\" Mr. Sullivan said. \"They are tying the hands of the design professionals.\"There are legitimate reasons for large areas in buildings for mechanical and structural features, he said. At 432 Park Avenue, clusters of unoccupied sections throughout the tower allow wind to flow through and stabilize the building.That tower's , said that without the large, open-air mechanical floors, 432 Park Avenue would noticeably sway and be unacceptable to residents.\"When they come home, they want to feel like they are at home and not like they are on a boat, airplane or motorcycle,\" he said.Mr. Marcus used a similar engineering technique at Central Park Tower, which at 1,550 feet tall will be among the most slender residential skyscrapers in the world. More than a fifth of its height will remain unoccupied.The developer of the building, Gary Barnett, said he believed the city's proposal was reasonable, but he said that critics had mischaracterized the mechanical spaces in Central Park Tower.\"There is one void and everything else is truly necessary mechanical space, amenity space and high-ceiling retail space for the first Nordstrom in New York City,\" Mr. Barnett said.Some supporters of the new legislation argue that the rules do not go far enough to curb supertall buildings. They would largely apply to neighborhoods around Central Park and would not touch other areas with high rises, including Midtown and Hudson Yards.City planners first noticed the trend of using mechanical spaces in new buildings several years ago.But a turning point emerged over the past year and a half when Rafael Vinoly Architects, which designed 432 Park Avenue, unveiled plans for another building, a futuristic, barbell-shaped 32-story residential tower on the Upper East Side. It would top out at 510 feet tall, thanks to a 150-foot-tall midsection devoid of residences.Neighborhood associations, along with Mr. Janes, the planning consultant, filed a complaint with the city's Department of Buildings, noting that \"the project includes a huge void, which is larger than necessary for any mechanical use.\"But without changes in building rules the tower would be likely to avoid legal challenges: The developers described the super large midsection as an open area with structural features."}[

Mueller III's report along with underlying evidence by May 1 and promised \"major hearings\" into its findings. And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts became the most prominent Democrat to call for impeachment.But most Republican lawmakers remained silent on the report, meaning any effort to force Mr. Trump from office faced long odds barring an unexpected change of political circumstances. The months to come may see more fireworks over the report, including a constitutional clash in court over releasing it in full, but privately some Democrats have concluded that the president's fate will probably be decided at the ballot box next year.While Mr. Trump had initially greeted the report as an exoneration, he spent at least part of the day in Florida stewing about disloyal aides who talked with investigators and sounded more defensive than celebratory. He expressed particular unhappiness over the report's inclusion of granular accounts of his efforts to derail the investigation based on F.B.I. interviews and notes of his own advisers.\"Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by 18 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated & totally untrue,\" . \"Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed.\"\"Because I never agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad),\" . \"This was an Illegally Started Hoax that never should have happened, a...\"At that point he stopped and did not finish the thought until : \"...big, fat waste of time, energy and money.\" He went on to vow to go after his pursuers, whom he called \"some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes, perhaps even Spying or Treason.\"The mention of notes appeared to refer to his former White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who told investigators that the president pressed him to have Mr. Mueller fired and complained when he took notes. Mr. Trump's lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, later on Friday. \"It can't be taken at face value,\" he said in an interview. \"It could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.\"But Mr. McGahn had no motive to lie, according to Mr. Mueller, and he rebutted Mr. Giuliani through his own lawyer. \"It's a mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to relitigate incidents the attorney general and deputy attorney general have concluded were not obstruction,\" said the lawyer, William A. Burck. \"But they are accurately described in the report.\"On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidates condemned the president's conduct and called for action against him.\"The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,\" , who is seeking the Democratic nomination. \"That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States.\"In an era of deep polarization, Mr. Mueller's 448-page report quickly became yet another case study in the disparate realities of American politics as each camp interpreted it through its own lens and sought to weaponize it against the other side.The president's defenders insisted he was cleared because even though Mr. Mueller confirmed a wide-ranging Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 election on Mr. Trump's behalf, the special counsel established no criminal conspiracy with his campaign and opted not to decide whether to accuse the president of obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump's critics called it a devastating indictment of a candidate willing to profit from the help of a foreign power and a president who repeatedly sought to disrupt or end the investigation even if he was not charged with violating the law.[]Few Republicans expressed concern about Mr. Mueller's findings, with most lawmakers out of town for the spring recess studiously avoiding comment. One of the exceptions was Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who said he was \"appalled\" that the president's campaign welcomed help from Russia.\"I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the president,\" . \"Reading the report,\" he added, \"is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders.\"Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said the report \"documents a number of actions taken by the president or his associates that were inappropriate,\" but pointed to the conclusion by Attorney General William P. Barr and his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, that the evidence did not warrant charging Mr. Trump.More typical among Republicans was the reaction of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been working closely with the White House on the crisis in Venezuela. \"We should ALL be alarmed at how effective Putin was & we should ALL be relieved, not disappointed, that President didn't collaborate with him,\" . issued on Friday by Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, escalated a fight with Mr. Barr over what material Congress is entitled to see from the investigation even as Democrats continued to pummel the attorney general for .Mr. Nadler asked for all evidence obtained by Mr. Mueller's investigators, including summaries of witness interviews and classified intelligence -- and indicated that he intended to air it to the public.\"Even the redacted version of the report outlines serious instances of wrongdoing by President Trump and some of his closest associates,\" Mr. Nadler said in a statement. \"It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of that alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward.\"The Justice Department dismissed the subpoena, saying that Mr. Barr had made \"only minimal redactions\" and offered to allow congressional leaders to view a version with even fewer deletions.\"In light of this, Congressman Nadler's subpoena is premature and unnecessary,\" said Kerri Kupec, a department spokeswoman. \"The department will continue to work with Congress to accommodate its legitimate requests consistent with the law and long-recognized executive branch interests.\"Mr. Barr redacted about 10 percent of the report, blacking out information that would divulge secret grand jury evidence, expose classified intelligence, compromise continuing investigations, or invade the privacy or damage the reputation of \"peripheral third parties.\" Democratic leaders on Friday rejected Mr. Barr's offer to show just select leaders a version with only the grand jury material redacted.[]Mr. Nadler's May 1 deadline falls a day before Mr. Barr is scheduled to testify publicly before the Judiciary Committee in what is expected to be an explosive session in which Democrats plan to excoriate his handling of the report and Republicans will urge their colleagues to accept that there was no criminality and move on.In addition to Mr. Barr's testimony and an outstanding invitation for Mr. Mueller, Mr. Nadler said on Friday that he would hold additional hearings to \"get to the bottom of this\" and \"educate the country as to what went on.\"\"The idea is not to decide whether to debate articles of impeachment -- we may get to that point,\" Mr. Nadler said in . \"The idea is to find out exactly what went on, who did what, what institutional safeguards were gotten around and how, and then decide what to do about it.\"Mr. Nadler's Republican counterpart on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, blasted the subpoena as going \"wildly overbroad\" and encouraged Mr. Nadler to narrow its terms and extend the response time. As written, he said, Mr. Nadler's subpoena was demanding \"millions of records that would be plainly against the law to share\" because of investigators' extensive use of a grand jury.\"The attorney general offered up a 400-page report that he wasn't bound to provide,\" Mr. Collins said. \"The attorney general stands ready to testify before our committee and to have the special counsel do the same. Yet Chairman Nadler disregards all of this good-faith transparency without even taking the department up on its offer to review material under the redactions.\"Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has publicly opposed impeachment unless Democrats can attract bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, where 20 Republicans would be needed to achieve the two-thirds vote required for conviction.Ms. Pelosi has scheduled a conference call for all House Democrats on Monday to discuss what she called \"a grave matter.\" Speaking to reporters in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where she was meeting with political leaders on Friday morning, Ms. Pelosi said she would not, as a matter of principle, criticize the president while out of the country.But she signaled that Congress would not sit by. \"We believe that Article I, the legislative branch, has the responsibility of oversight of our democracy, and we will exercise that,\" she said.She faces a restive liberal base that is pressing her to go further and open a formal impeachment inquiry.\"Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the closely watched New York freshman, . \"But,\" she added, \"the report squarely puts this on our doorstep.\"Other Democrats were more reluctant, arguing that the party was better off litigating the future on the campaign trail.\"We should certainly see the entire, unredacted report,\" said Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. \"But if we spend the next six months obsessed with this alone, instead of job training, health care and infrastructure, that would be a big mistake.\""},

The study, recently published by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Lehigh University, suggests that women who travel 50 or more miles each way to work by car may be at a \"much greater risk\" of having low-birth-weight babies (under 5.5 pounds) as well as fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction -- a condition, in which the fetus doesn't grow as fast as expected, that's with mothers who have diabetes, high blood pressure, malnutrition or infections including syphilis.Worse, for every 10 miles of travel distance added to a long commute, the probability of low birth weight goes up by 0.9 percentage points and the probability of intrauterine growth restriction rises by 0.6 percentage points, according to the study, which looked at pregnant women in New Jersey (a state with some of the longest commute times in the nation).It did not conclude what might be causing these adverse outcomes, but it found that pregnant women with long commutes were more likely to miss doctor appointments and delay treatment. Among these women, 15 percent skipped their first prenatal checkup or put off their first prenatal visit -- some as late as their third trimester.It also suggested that maternal stress, exacerbated by commuting, might be a factor. The researchers said they hoped their work would lead to policy changes to expand maternity leave to include the prenatal period. For pregnant women with long commutes, time off can be \"particularly important,\" they wrote.______That's how many Americans believe men are better suited emotionally for politics than most women, according to a new report from Georgetown University. That number is down considerably from 1975, when almost 50 percent of Americans doubted that women were emotionally fit for politics. .______ Brazil requires that at least 30 percent of each party's candidates be women, but that did little to boost the participation of women.

At a dinner that Shaywitz attended with female colleagues, for example, the conversation turned to boasts about who had been able to leave their baby the fastest and get back to work -- an approach \"applauded by the feminists\" of the era, she wrote. \"In essence, we were telling each other what society had told us: If you want to mother and to work, your external gratification will be based on how much you can deny your maternal instincts,\" she wrote.In many ways, Shaywitz was ahead of her time, her thoughts more in line with feminism today. A mother's desire to be with her child should be \"acknowledged as a valid need,\" she wrote. \"Women should no longer have to go, head bowed, to their superiors asking for extra time off to be with their children.\" "},

Not Trump's.", "authors": "Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman", "contents": "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- After admitting to investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that she delivered a false statement from the White House podium, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended herself in Trumpian fashion on Friday morning. She counterattacked. revealed that Ms. Sanders had acknowledged that her repeated claim in 2017 that she had personally communicated with \"countless\" F.B.I. officials who told her they were happy with President Trump's decision to fire James B. Comey as the agency's director was a \"slip of the tongue\" and not founded on any facts.Asked on \"Good Morning America\" if the report had damaged her credibility, Ms. Sanders responded that she had made the statement in the heat of the moment, and that it was not \"a scripted talking point.\"But then she added, \"I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot like the Democrat Party that went out for two and a half years and repeated time and time again that there was definitely Russian collusion between the president and his campaign.\"It has been a hallmark of the Trump White House never to admit a mistake, never to apologize and never to cede a point. This case was no different. \"The White House staff will never be lectured on truth-telling from the media that pushed a flat-out lie about Donald Trump for two years,\" Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in an email.Ms. Sanders, who has often taken news media outlets to task for what they write and report and has accused them of spreading \"fake news\" about Mr. Trump, was just a footnote in Mr. Mueller's 448-page report. But because of her public role, the anecdote involving her false statement loomed large in the broader portrait by the special counsel of a White House .And it remains to be seen how the incident and Ms. Sanders's response will affect her credibility with reporters, with whom she has had fewer interactions than many of her predecessors since the White House quietly phased out the daily press briefing over the past nine months.More often, Ms. Sanders speaks for the president on friendly programs like \"Fox & Friends.\" She has also come to view her role as a person who defends her colleagues and the president, rather than someone who delivers a message to the press about the work that is underway at the White House.Some of Mr. Trump's aides and allies acknowledged on Friday that it was problematic for the president's chief spokeswoman to spend airtime defending her own credibility. But White House officials -- some of whom think Ms. Sanders is taking an unfair beating in the press -- do not expect Mr. Trump to be fazed by the controversy. Unlike previous administrations, in which officials feared blows to their credibility in public, Mr. Trump's press aides are generally performing for an audience of one -- the president.For months, Ms. Sanders, who declined to comment, has toyed with the idea of moving on from a position she has held for almost two years as part of a White House press and communications team that has often seemed dysfunctional.The job of communications director has remained vacant since Bill Shine, the fifth person to hold the position, . Along with Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, and Mercedes Schlapp, a top communications adviser, Ms. Sanders is now viewed internally as part of a three-headed messaging operation, and it is not clear who is really in charge, other than Mr. Trump.Ms. Sanders's predecessor, Sean Spicer, suffered his own reputational damage on Day 1 of the administration, when Mr. Trump ordered him to falsely tell reporters that the crowd at his inauguration was \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" Mr. Spicer has since said he regretted that comment and his belligerent appearance in the briefing room that day, which also enraged the president.But for now, Ms. Sanders is not willing to admit any misstep.In an interview with Fox News on Thursday night, she told Sean Hannity that \"I acknowledged that I had a slip of the tongue when I used the word 'countless,' but it's not untrue\" because her broader point was that \"a number of both current and former F.B.I. agents agreed with the president.\"In her interview with George Stephanopoulos on \"Good Morning America,\" he also grilled her about her false statement that Mr. Trump did not dictate the administration's statement on a meeting that his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took with a Russian operative at Trump Tower in June 2016. Mr. Mueller's report revealed that the president's lawyers acknowledged that he did, in fact, dictate the statement that was released.\"I'm not denying that he had involvement in what the statement said,\" Ms. Sanders said on Friday. \"That was the information I was given at the time.\"In previous administrations, when it was revealed that press secretaries had delivered false statements from the White House podium, there was more of a reaction and often some soul-searching.\"She is in a credibility bind that in most White Houses would be disqualifying, but probably not in this one,\" said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"No matter how honorable you were coming in, when you sign up as the spokesman for someone who habitually lies, you, by necessity, become a habitual liar.\"In 2003, Scott McClellan, President George W. Bush's press secretary, told reporters that two senior administration officials, Karl Rove and I. Lewis Libby Jr., were \"not involved\" in a leak about Valerie Plame, the C.I.A. operative.Later, in his memoir, Mr. McClellan delivered a mea culpa, admitting that he had been given false information to disseminate to the press. \"I had unknowingly passed along false information,\" Mr. McClellan wrote, adding that five of the highest-ranking White House officials, including the president, had misinformed him.Others have survived accusations that they lied. In 1983, Larry Speakes, a press aide to President Ronald Reagan, told reporters that the notion that the United States would invade Grenada was \"preposterous.\" The invasion took place the next day, and Mr. Speakes said he learned of it belatedly.Jay Carney, Mr. Obama's press secretary, took heat for helping to propagate the president's message on the Affordable Care Act that \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\" after it became clear that the administration was unable to deliver on the promise.But for veteran aides of the Trump White House, the furor over Ms. Sanders's remark has only added to a bunker mentality shared by aides who feel they are constantly defending themselves, and the president, from unfair attacks.And on the president's favorite show, Ms. Sanders had the last word. \"James Comey was a disgraced leaker who tried to politicize and undermine the very agency he was supposed to run,\" she told Mr. Hannity. \"Firing James Comey remains one of the best decisions that the president made.\""},

Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, praised President Trump last spring for backing the rule of law and commended the Constitution and American culture for protecting lawfulness. \"I don't think there's any threat to the rule of law in America today,\" he said at a .Mr. Rosenstein left unmentioned that he and other senior leaders at the department and the F.B.I. were enduring Mr. Trump's sustained attacks on law enforcement in both public and private. The president had demanded Mr. Rosenstein falsely claim responsibility for dismissing the bureau's director and had toyed with firing the attorney general, prompting Mr. Rosenstein and the Justice Department's No. 3 official to vow to quit if the termination happened.The long-awaited report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, released on Thursday painted a portrait of law enforcement leaders more fiercely under siege than previously known. They struggled to navigate Mr. Trump's apparent disregard for their mission through a mix of threats to resign, quiet defiance and capitulation to some presidential demands. While their willingness to stay quiet might have protected their institutions, it also helped empower Mr. Trump to continue his attacks.Mr. Trump made good on some threats, the day after the midterm elections in November. The third-ranking Justice Department official, Rachel Brand, left three months before Mr. Rosenstein's speech to become Walmart's top lawyer. Mr. Rosenstein, who had an inside look at the investigation as its overseer and at Mr. Trump's behavior as a top political appointee, .\"The bad news is that the attacks were relentless, but the good news is that the department has a thin political layer and a strong tradition of professionalism,\" said Chuck Rosenberg, a former chief of staff to the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump, James B. Comey. \"But to see it and to read about the president's behavior is deeply disturbing.\"The president sought to undermine the Justice Department's leaders and thwart the Russia investigation from his first days in office.He demanded that Mr. Comey publicly say that he was not under investigation, and he asked Dana J. Boente, who was briefly the acting attorney general before Mr. Sessions was confirmed in February 2017, to let him know whether the F.B.I. was investigating the White House, according to the special counsel's report.His attacks on law enforcement were most vividly embodied in his treatment of Mr. Sessions, who was himself investigated by the F.B.I. over whether he lied about contacts he had with Russian officials during the election, the report said.Mr. Sessions, a top 2016 Trump campaign supporter, recused himself early into his tenure from election-related investigations, drawing Mr. Trump's ire. After the , the president demanded Mr. Sessions's resignation, saying he wanted an attorney general who would harness the Justice Department's power to protect the presidency.Mr. Sessions submitted his resignation, touching off a scramble among White House aides to keep the president from accepting it. While he let Mr. Sessions keep his job, Mr. Trump pocketed his resignation letter and set off fears within the White House that he would wield it to get what he wanted from law enforcement officials.Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff, told Mr. Sessions that the president could use the letter as a kind of \"shock collar,\" according to the report, and he told Mr. Trump that he had \"D.O.J. by the throat.\" It took Mr. Priebus two weeks to get the president to hand over the letter.Seeking a loyal attorney general, Mr. Trump asked a White House aide about Ms. Brand, a George W. Bush administration veteran. Was she \"on the team,\" and could he gauge her appetite for overseeing the Mueller inquiry or even becoming the attorney general?But the aide never reached out to Ms. Brand \"because he was sensitive to the implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an effort to end the investigation or fire the special counsel,\" according to the report.When Mr. Trump pushed Mr. Priebus to secure Mr. Sessions's resignation, Mr. Priebus warned the president that both Mr. Rosenstein and Ms. Brand would also resign, a scenario certain to plunge the Justice Department into crisis.The president agreed to hold off on firing Mr. Sessions for a day, to prevent the Sunday morning television news shows from focusing on it, and eventually dropped his plan to oust him. Instead, he stepped up his public criticisms. The attacks became so pointed, harsh and relentless that Mr. Sessions prepared another resignation letter and carried it with him whenever he went to the White House, according to the report.\"Attorney General Sessions carrying a resignation letter with him each time he had a meeting at the White House is a vivid reflection of the dysfunctional and unprecedented approach this president has taken towards the Department of Justice and federal law enforcement,\" said Matthew S. Axelrod, a partner at Linklaters and a former Justice Department official and prosecutor under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama.Mr. Sessions resisted multiple entreaties to reverse his recusal so he could oversee and curtail the Mueller inquiry; by the time the criminal investigation of him ended in March 2018, he could do little to get back in the president's graces.Mr. Rosenstein, whose office received briefings every other week on the progress of the investigation, would have glimpsed the gravity of the situation as the special counsel interviewed witnesses.He was also in the unusual position of being a witness himself in the investigation that he oversaw. Critics have said that role should have prompted Mr. Rosenstein to recuse himself from the inquiry, but top ethics lawyers at the Justice Department cleared him to oversee the special counsel, a department spokeswoman said. She added that the special counsel's office never asked about or questioned that decision.After Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey as the director of the F.B.I., setting off a storm of criticism, he asked Mr. Rosenstein to give a news conference and say that the firing had been his idea.Mr. Rosenstein warned the president that the news conference was a bad idea \",\" Mr. Mueller's investigators wrote. Mr. Sessions told White House lawyers that Mr. Rosenstein was upset about being used as a pretext for the ouster, and both officials told Donald F. McGahn II, then the White House counsel, that Mr. Trump was spinning a false narrative about Mr. Rosenstein's role in the termination.Mr. Rosenstein proved to be deeply rattled during the chaotic days after Mr. Comey's firing. He discussed the possibility of to remove Mr. Trump as president and suggested that he secretly record Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, according to people briefed on the events. Mr. Rosenstein has denied their accounts.When those revelations surfaced in news reports more than a year later, in September 2018, Mr. Rosenstein braced himself to be fired. But after meeting with Mr. Trump and his aides, Mr. Rosenstein and oversaw the Mueller investigation through the end.In February, he once again complimented Mr. Trump in about the rule of law.\"I'm very confident that when we look back in the long run on this era of the Department of Justice,\" he said, \"the president will deserve credit for the folks that he appointed to run the department.\"Attorney General William P. Barr, who took office that month, appears to be trying to reset the relationship between the White House and the Justice Department. He has helped further the president's agenda on and , and he has vowed to investigate whether the Russia investigation was tainted by what he called unlawful \".\"He also worked to offset the Mueller report's damning portrait of Mr. Trump. On Thursday, just before the report's release, Mr. Barr held a news conference in which he offered a striking defense of Mr. Trump, highlighting facts to help build a case for exoneration and avoiding assertions that were more damaging for the president.\"There was relentless speculation in the news media about the president's personal culpability,\" Mr. Barr told reporters. \"Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.\""},

I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \"reasonable\" elites.

These days people on the right and the left both use \"liberal\" as an epithet, but that's basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump's presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I've written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise.

Schmidt, Maggie Haberman", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump's lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, attacked the credibility of a former White House counsel on Friday, saying his account of how Mr. Trump told him to remove the special counsel was inaccurate.Mr. Giuliani's statement was the most extensive pushback by the president's lawyers against the former counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who cooperated extensively with the special counsel's investigators. The , released on Thursday, also included several damning examples of how Mr. Trump tried to interfere with the investigation, like Mr. McGahn's account.\"It can't be taken at face value,\" Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. \"It could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.\"Mr. McGahn's lawyer, William A. Burck, pushed back on Mr. Giuliani's attack.\"It's a mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to relitigate incidents the attorney general and deputy attorney general have concluded were not obstruction,\" Mr. Burck said. \"But they are accurately described in the report.\"The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, examined a wide range of actions that Mr. Trump took as president that could be considered obstruction of justice. Investigators relied heavily on Mr. McGahn, who provided detailed accounts of what Mr. Trump did and said behind closed doors as he tried to maintain control over the Russia investigation.Among the damaging episodes was one based largely on Mr. McGahn that laid out how Mr. Trump told him in June 2017 to have Mr. Mueller ousted because he had several conflict of interest issues. Mr. McGahn believed the conflicts had little merit and told senior White House officials that he was going to resign instead of carrying out Mr. Trump's order.Mr. Giuliani said that the president never asked Mr. McGahn to have Mr. Mueller removed, adding that Mr. Trump was simply venting about his frustrations with the special counsel's investigation, which had cast a cloud over his presidency.\"If it were subject to cross-examination or analysis, it would be a different version,\" Mr. Giuliani said.On the day Mr. McGahn threatened to quit, Mr. Burck told him to hold back on telling other White House officials about what the president was asking him to do. Mr. Burck wanted to stop Mr. McGahn from roping other White House officials into the obstruction of justice investigation and from creating the impression that Mr. McGahn was willing to help Mr. Trump oust Mr. Mueller.Because Mr. McGahn mainly discussed the issue with Mr. Burck, there are not many witnesses to back him up. In an effort to substantiate Mr. McGahn's credibility, Mr. Mueller's team obtained Mr. McGahn's phone records from the episode. Although Mr. McGahn told investigators that there were two conversations he had with Mr. Trump, the records show only one call, according the report.\"While McGahn was not certain of the specific dates of the calls,\" the report said, \"McGahn was confident that he had at least two phone conversations with the president in which the president directed him to call the acting attorney general to have the special counsel removed.\"The report said that investigators accepted Mr. McGahn's account because he was \"a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.\"In attacking Mr. McGahn, Mr. Giuliani went further than the president had earlier Friday, when he walked up to the line of calling Mr. McGahn out on Twitter. that \"statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by 18 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated & totally untrue.\"\"Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed,\" the president tweeted."},

Wouldn't something be lost, she asked, if the historically diverse slate of 2020 Democrats was passed over?\"Personally I'd love to see a woman,\" Ms. Neal, also 27, said at the event on Thursday night. \"If people are being catty and holding gender or race against a candidate, it would break my heart.\"As former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the 2020 race this coming week, Democrats have seen the strong diversity in their field -- with candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris reflecting the and largely base of the party -- become somewhat overshadowed by white male candidates. Bernie Sanders has , he and Mr. Biden lead in , and Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg have enjoyed outsize from in early primary states, extensive media coverage and viral success with online donors.Interviews with several dozen Democratic voters around the country show how the party, which enjoyed victories in 2018 that were powered by female and nonwhite candidates, is now grappling with two complicated questions about race, gender and politics in the Trump era.Is a white male the best face for an increasingly diverse Democratic Party in 2020? And what's the bigger gamble: to nominate a white man and risk disappointing some of the party's base, or nominate a minority candidate or a woman who might struggle to carry predominantly white swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that both Barack Obama and Mr. Trump won?Pam Van Arsdale, 64, of Bedford, N.H., said she would like to see a minority or female candidate catch fire, and worries that nominating a white man could cause some liberals to skip voting in November 2020.\"I consider myself a centrist, middle-of-the-road Democrat. And the progressive side worries me. What are they going to do? Are they going to sit it out if they don't like the top candidate?\" she said while attending a recent event for .But Lee Kujawa, 72, of Wauwatosa, Wis., near Milwaukee, made a case for Mr. Biden, seeing him as \"the most electable.\"\"He can stand up to Trump,\" said Mr. Kujawa, who said he believed the party would not pay a penalty by nominating its first white male nominee since John Kerry in 2004. Referring to Mr. Biden, he said, \"He could pick Kamala Harris as a running mate; she's one of my top three favorites.\"[]White men have largely ruled both the Democratic and Republican parties throughout American history, even as they have declined to roughly 30 percent of the population, and many voters still have preconceptions of presidents as white and male. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are starting off with other advantages as well: They are the best-known candidates at this stage, both with experience running for president, and they are well positioned to have the money and resources to compete through the 2020 primaries.But as older white men, they are out of step with ascendant forces in the party today.Women, minorities and young people are fueling much of its energy, and they are well represented by multiple well-qualified, politically savvy female and nonwhite Democrats who are running. Ms. Harris in particular has had , and only Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders consistently outpace her in polls.The party also has a new primary calendar for 2020 that could help these candidates: The diverse Democratic electorates in California and Texas will vote earlier than usual, and candidates like Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker could also benefit from in the early primary state of South Carolina.Many of the voters interviewed said that the most important qualification was the ability to defeat Mr. Trump, who has come away from the recent release of the Mueller report more angry than elated and wants a political victory untainted by questions of legitimacy. To some, the best Democratic candidate will be one who can wrest voters who backed Mr. Trump in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as Democrats did somewhat successfully in 2018 to flip the House.Jason Pinkowski, 35, who lives in the Milwaukee suburbs, crossed off several Democrats -- Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders because they are too old, and Mr. O'Rourke because he is too young -- to arrive at Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris as his current favorites.\"Long story short, if a Democrat decides to put time in the Midwest, I think he or she will have a good chance,\" he said.The presumption that Democrats will turn out in force to beat Mr. Trump, no matter who the nominee is, has hurt the party before. Hillary Clinton, her campaign strategy, the news media and the F.B.I. have all been blamed for her loss. For whatever reason, she lost votes in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 compared to Mr. Obama in 2012, including a notable falloff among black voters.Mr. Trump, in turn, energized the Republican base, which appears to remain loyal to him for the most part, and also won over some Midwest voters who once backed Mr. Obama.David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the key to threading the electoral needle in 2020 was a diverse presidential ticket able to stop the hemorrhaging of white rural voters and to excite minority voters. He pointed to Senator Sherrod Brown's success in Ohio in appealing to both electorates in his 2018 re-election in a state that otherwise voted for Republicans in statewide campaigns.\"If between the ticket you have someone who's got that economic populist brand of a Sherrod Brown, but also the diversity that will energize Cuyahoga County so that you have a margin of 200,000-plus versus 150,000, I think you win Ohio and all the rest of those Midwest states,\" Mr. Pepper said. He was referring to the Democrat-rich county dominated by the predominantly black city of Cleveland. (To be sure, Mr. Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016.)[]Others see the focus on electability as too limited -- and even as an underhanded way to discount black and female candidates.For this group, which includes voters and several political observers who focus on race and gender, there is a particular annoyance around code words they feel unduly penalize candidates. Questions about which contender is \"electable\" and who can \"bring the country together\" distract from areas where female and minority candidates may lead the pack, including policy proposals and who best energizes typical nonvoters.Compounding these frustrations have been Ms. Warren's campaign fund-raising struggles and the early buzz around candidates like Mr. O'Rourke, who himself has acknowledged that he benefits from white male privilege.\"Bringing the country together won't happen right now, so just vote for the best progressive policy,\" said Kyrsten Matthews, 29, who attended Ms. Warren's Birmingham, Ala., rally. \"I know that's what I'm going to do.\"For some voters interviewed during Ms. Warren's , which included stops in heavily black communities in Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, there was interest in candidates such as Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Sanders or Mr. Biden because of factors unrelated to identity.In Selma, Ala., Roderick West, 62, said he was looking to support Mr. Biden because of his experience as vice president. Supporters of Mr. Sanders say his calls for wide-scale change in the country's economic order make him a transformational candidate, regardless of skin color. And some admirers of Mr. Buttigieg say that, as a gay man, he brings diversity to the field and would be a history-making nominee.In conversations across eastern Iowa, Democratic voters acknowledged a feeling of whiplash after a midterm campaign defined largely by the success of women and people of color. Many of those interviewed seemed almost resigned to having a white male nominee, reserving their angst for what they view as a greater priority than diversity atop the Democratic ticket: defeating Mr. Trump.\"It's important to appeal to Republicans. I don't know if a minority candidate can do that,\" Catherine Rohret, who will turn 18 in June, said moments after watching Mr. O'Rourke campaign in Waterloo, Iowa. \"It hurts me to say because I'm a black woman. I would love to see a woman candidate.\"Rachel Cox, 35, from Iowa City, seemed exultant despite frigid temperatures moments after meeting Mr. O'Rourke at a St. Patrick's Day 5K in North Liberty, Iowa. A former Texan who waited until after the 2018 midterms to switch her registration to Iowa -- so she could vote for Mr. O'Rourke -- Ms. Cox said that a white male candidate might be better positioned to build a winning coalition.\"There could be two sides to that story,\" she said when asked if nominating another white man could depress turnout in some corners of the party. \"Beto could bring a lot of moderate Republicans who are maybe a little bit averse to voting for women or voting for minorities.\"Ms. Cox had good reason to be concerned about the role of discrimination in voter choices. In several instances during Ms. Warren's Southern tour, men who attended an event with the Massachusetts senator dismissed supporting her candidacy using sexist terminology.\"Trump will run over a woman,\" Carl West, 64, said as he walked to see Ms. Warren at the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. \"He'll just run a woman into the ground.\"Diane Henning, 70, a retired bookkeeper outside of Milwaukee, disagreed sharply. She said it would be a mistake for Democrats to nominate a white man in 2020.\"There are so many good women out there who could do the job,\" she said. \"I think women are a lot more open-minded, we certainly have been all of these years.\"For Hannah Reid, 22, who is a graduating senior at the University of Tampa and heard Mr. Buttigieg at an event recently, her decision making on a Democratic candidate will go beyond identity.\"I am a woman of color, but that's not all that I am,\" said Ms. Reid, who is black. Referring to Mr. Buttigieg, she said: \"He's in the L.G.B.T. community, which is something we've never seen before. It's got to be about more than just who you are; it's got to be about what you think and what you say, what your ideas are.\""},

Mueller III, and in the end agreed to . Even then, with the help of his lawyers, the president found it difficult to summon details from his presidential campaign in 2016 that might shed light on what happened.More than 30 times, he that he had no memory of what they were asking about, employing several formulations to make the same point.\"I do not remember.\"\"I do not recall.\"\"I have no recollection.\"\"I have no independent recollection.\"\"I have no current recollection.\"He did not remember learning about a held in June 2016 by his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman with visiting Russians promising \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. He did not remember being told in advance of Russian hacking of Democratic emails before the stolen messages were posted online.He did not remember any particular conversations with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser, during the last months of the campaign, much less discussions with him about WikiLeaks. He did not remember discussing a possible trip to Russia to promote a proposed tower project in Moscow. He did not remember an invitation from Russia's deputy prime minister to attend an economic forum in St. Petersburg.A fuzzy memory is not exactly unusual for any president given how much they typically juggle, much less a 72-year-old president who is the oldest ever elected for the first time. But Mr. Mueller's prosecutors considered his memory lapses unsatisfying and pressed Mr. Trump's lawyer again for an in-person interview, to no avail.\"The written responses, we informed counsel, 'demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask follow-up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client's recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection,'\" said.Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's private lawyers, defended his client's answers on Friday. \"The president responded to the questions,\" he said. \"They are answers, not speculations.\"Mr. Trump rarely lacks for certainty in his public statements on camera, but has shown more caution when under oath.He said, \"I don't remember\" in a lawsuit involving his now-defunct Trump University and related to the university suit three years later, not counting 10 more times in the two interviews that he said, \"I don't recall\" or \"Can't remember.\" (He eventually for $25 million.)Prosecutors said such selective memory tended to make them suspicious.\"It's always a red flag when a witness appears to selectively forget the events most likely to be damning,\" said Dwight C. Holton, who spent 14 years as a prosecutor, most recently as United States attorney in Oregon.\"And when you have a witness who repeatedly and publicly thumps his chest about how great his memory is, then all of a sudden he has sudden massive memory loss -- well, let's just say that's a target I'd like to cross-examine in front of a jury.\"Barbara L. McQuade, a former United States attorney in Michigan, said the president's answers \"demonstrate why written answers are a poor substitute for an in-person interview.\"During a face-to-face encounter, she said, prosecutors can refresh a witness's memory by providing additional details or showing him documents. They can also come to a judgment based on body language.\"I have not dealt with a witness who has claimed not to remember facts as many times as Trump did, but it is impossible to read a witness's mind to know whether he is telling the truth,\" she said. \"Trump's refusal to participate in an interview,\" she added, \"hampered Mueller's investigation and contradicts\" the assertion by Attorney General William P. Barr that the president had cooperated fully.But it may have saved him from a worse outcome. Mr. Mueller began asking Mr. Trump for an interview in December 2017 only to be put off for months. The president's lawyers opposed the idea, worried that Mr. Trump, who has a documented history of making untrue assertions publicly, would testify falsely and walk into what they deemed a perjury trap.Bowing to the demands of the president's lawyers, Mr. Mueller agreed to submit written questions, and only about contacts with Russia before Mr. Trump took office, not about potential obstruction of justice once he entered the White House. When , they were so \"incomplete or imprecise,\" the report said, that Mr. Mueller complained to the president's legal team about \"the insufficiency of those responses.\"The answers Mr. Trump provided sounded more like lawyer speak than the blunt-talking president's usual colorful language. They included phrases like \"named entities or individuals\" and \"tangible support\" and \"no meaningful relationship.\"It may be hard to imagine Mr. Trump saying or writing this: \"In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the campaign documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution and sources of information for the speech I expected to give 'probably' on the Monday following my June 7, 2016, comments.\"But if his memory were hazy in many cases, it was crystal clear in at least one instance. Asked about a specific date that June, Mr. Trump noted that he had prevailed in Republican nomination contests in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana and South Dakota that day. \"I remember winning those primaries,\" he wrote.After Mr. Mueller pressed again for an in-person interview in December, Mr. Trump's lawyers refused again. The special counsel opted not to seek a subpoena to force the president to talk, unlike Ken Starr, the independent counsel who in 1998 subpoenaed President Bill Clinton and withdrew the order only after the president's legal team .Mr. Mueller said he had chosen not to press the issue because he had already \"made significant progress\" and a court fight to enforce a subpoena against a sitting president, even if successful, could prolong the investigation. \"We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation,\" the report said, \"against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report.\"Critics of Mr. Trump have questioned that decision, saying the special counsel should have held out for a formal interview. As it happened, by sticking to carefully scripted written answers, the president avoided any charge that he had misled investigators.That is an outcome neither he nor Mr. Mueller is likely to forget."},

About a quarter of its 88 floors will have no homes because they are filled with structural and mechanical equipment.The building and nearby towers are able to push high into the sky because of a loophole in the city's labyrinthine zoning laws. Floors reserved for structural and mechanical equipment, no matter how much, do not count against a building's maximum size under the laws, so developers explicitly use them to make buildings far higher than would otherwise be permitted.The towers benefiting the most from the zoning quirk have all sprouted during the past half-decade: enormous glass and steel buildings with lavish condominiums that sell for millions of dollars. Many line the blocks around Central Park, some of the most expensive and coveted real estate in the city, and have become second homes for Chinese billionaires, European tycoons and out-of-state hedge fund investors.But the proliferation of these buildings is provoking a backlash amid a broader debate about affordable housing, megaprojects for the ultrarich and the city's identity. Now, officials are seeking to rein in developers by proposing rules that would apply unusually large mechanical spaces toward a building's height limit.The motivation to build tall is obvious: panoramic views for residents and hefty profits for developers. A 95th floor condominium at 432 Park Avenue sold in December for $30.7 million, or about $7,592 a square foot. That same month, a unit about halfway down the building sold for $4,216 a square foot.\"It's pretty outrageous, but it's also pretty clever,\" said George M. Janes, a planning consultant who has tracked and filed challenges against buildings in New York with vast unoccupied spaces. \"What is the primary purpose of these spaces? The primary purpose is to build very tall buildings.\"The effort by the city to curb building heights has ignited a showdown with the powerful real estate industry, which has criticized the proposed rules as overly restrictive and misguided.Harry B. Macklowe, who developed 432 Park Avenue, said he agrees with the effort to establish firm rules around mechanical spaces, but he rejected claims that his building was using them to rise higher. Every mechanical floor, he said, has equipment necessary for the building to function.\"It offends me,\" Mr. Macklowe said, \"because we created a very nice building that fits into the skyline perfectly.\"Many of these towers stay vacant most of the year, so their owners are not subject to local and state income taxes because they are not city residents. As a result, the state and city have already begun a separate crackdown on them.State lawmakers proposed a pied-a-terre tax, an annual recurring tax on second homes valued at more than $5 million, but it was derailed . Instead, a one-time fee on the sale of multimillion-dollar homes.New York City's complicated building regulations are meant to produce predictable developments. Height requirements are imposed in most of the city, though parts of Manhattan are exempt. Every block is also effectively assigned a maximum square footage, which can be spread across smaller buildings on a block or condensed in larger developments.Savvy, well-heeled and patient developers have worked that system to their benefit. A developer seeking to build a supertall tower might start with one lot on a block and then buy unused square footage from its neighbors.With advancements in engineering and construction, that developer can take the accumulated square footage and concentrate it in a skinny mega-tower. Floors of mechanical space, exempt from the square footage calculations, make the tower even taller.\"There is no question that they have become this lightning rod because they are not just luxury housing but uber-luxury housing,\" said Elizabeth Goldstein, president of the Municipal Art Society, a nonprofit group that seeks to preserve the city's architecture and urban design. She said they were unaffordable not only for the 99 percent but also for most of the 1 percent.The city's proposal aimed at supertall buildings -- which needs to be approved by the City Council -- would not eliminate enormous mechanical spaces but would penalize projects that have them.Oversized mechanical floors -- those greater than 30 feet tall, or about three times the size of a typical apartment's ceiling height -- would be counted toward the building's maximum size. The rules would largely apply to developments around Central Park and in parts of Lower Manhattan.Two other cities with skyscrapers, Chicago and Miami, have similar zoning codes but regulate mechanical floors differently.In Chicago, big empty spaces -- those greater than 5,000 square feet -- are not counted toward the tower's overall size, though officials said they knew of no complaints about developers exploiting the rule. In Miami, mechanical spaces are subtracted from the maximum size unless the area is an atrium or an open-air feature.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the proposed rules would \"stop luxury developers from gaming the system.\"\"Artificially tall mechanical spaces that serve no purpose but to boost views of top-floor apartments violate the spirit of our zoning regulations,\" Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.But the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's influential lobbying arm, said the rules were too restrictive and at odds with engineering trends, such as the future need for large spaces for batteries to support renewable energy.At a recent public hearing, engineers and architects said the proposal would drive up the cost of construction.Bart A. Sullivan, an engineer in New York who has worked on high rises around the world, said supertall skyscrapers need large unoccupied floors for complex mechanical and structural equipment, including elevator motors, heating, ventilation and air conditioning.Developers, he said, could work within the proposed restrictions but would have to spend more on structural features.\"Most anything is possible if you throw enough money at it, but these projects have to make sense from an economic point of view,\" Mr. Sullivan said. \"They are tying the hands of the design professionals.\"There are legitimate reasons for large areas in buildings for mechanical and structural features, he said. At 432 Park Avenue, clusters of unoccupied sections throughout the tower allow wind to flow through and stabilize the building.That tower's , said that without the large, open-air mechanical floors, 432 Park Avenue would noticeably sway and be unacceptable to residents.\"When they come home, they want to feel like they are at home and not like they are on a boat, airplane or motorcycle,\" he said.Mr. Marcus used a similar engineering technique at Central Park Tower, which at 1,550 feet tall will be among the most slender residential skyscrapers in the world. More than a fifth of its height will remain unoccupied.The developer of the building, Gary Barnett, said he believed the city's proposal was reasonable, but he said that critics had mischaracterized the mechanical spaces in Central Park Tower.\"There is one void and everything else is truly necessary mechanical space, amenity space and high-ceiling retail space for the first Nordstrom in New York City,\" Mr. Barnett said.Some supporters of the new legislation argue that the rules do not go far enough to curb supertall buildings. They would largely apply to neighborhoods around Central Park and would not touch other areas with high rises, including Midtown and Hudson Yards.City planners first noticed the trend of using mechanical spaces in new buildings several years ago.But a turning point emerged over the past year and a half when Rafael Vinoly Architects, which designed 432 Park Avenue, unveiled plans for another building, a futuristic, barbell-shaped 32-story residential tower on the Upper East Side. It would top out at 510 feet tall, thanks to a 150-foot-tall midsection devoid of residences.Neighborhood associations, along with Mr. Janes, the planning consultant, filed a complaint with the city's Department of Buildings, noting that \"the project includes a huge void, which is larger than necessary for any mechanical use.\"But without changes in building rules the tower would be likely to avoid legal challenges: The developers described the super large midsection as an open area with structural features."},

Lawyers don't take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.\"Of all the hallucinogenic moments , this is one of the most dizzying. McGahn has been summoned to the White House in February 2018 because a livid Trump wants him to deny something truthful. McGahn explains that he can't \"correct\" an accurate report in The Times that the president had instructed him to \" He takes notes because he's a \"real lawyer.\"In fact McGahn, like many sucked into Trump's corrupting White House orbit, takes notes in the same way people try to get themselves inoculated when they enter a zone of contagion. He wants a contemporaneous record of the truth to protect himself and -- God knows -- the Republic against Trump's lies. He knows what an oath to uphold the Constitution means. If there is one overwhelming conclusion of the Mueller report it is that Trump, a.k.a. \"boss man,\" holds the law and truth in utter contempt. That this is unsurprising only makes it more appalling.\"I've had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn,\" Trump tells McGahn. \"He did not take notes.\" You don't take notes when you want no record of your dereliction. Of course, Cohn is Trump's role model: In New York, Cohn, McCarthyism's ruthless enforcer, was disbarred including dishonesty and fraud. The Mueller report won't move the political needle. Trump's tens of millions of supporters know all this. They knew he was a scam artist before they voted for him in 2016. One of the reasons the report is devastating is that its portrait of an iniquitous presidency once again begs a question of all Americans: How did we put this man in the Oval Office?It's a question for everyone. To deflect responsibility is too easy. The mirror Trump holds up is to America in its entirety, from Hudson Yards to the death of Main Street, from the Kardashians to the opioid crisis, from the financiers doing the rigging to those left out or left behind, from callow Republicans to compromised Democrats.The idea of America as a land of unbound self-invention is not new -- F. Scott Fitzgerald captured that in \"The Great Gatsby.\" America is about forgetting, hence the extravagance of its creations. Still, Trump's self-invention is remarkable for its scale and depravity -- the way he grasped how hyper-individualism, the money culture, simmering anger, and the collapse of the line between truth and falsehood could be channeled into a victorious presidential campaign. How, in short, he could become the orange icon of the Age of the Unicorn.The great parable of our age is John Carreyrou's \"Bad Blood,\" a remarkable account of how a 20-something Stanford dropout, Elizabeth Holmes, built a company called Theranos that fooled everyone with a supposedly transformational method to test blood. Holmes's pinprick testing that would do away with the hypodermic needle never worked. It was fakery.There was no there there in Theranos, There was only Holmes with her strange baritone parlaying zilch into a company once valued at an estimated $9 billion. She entranced a kind of American Who's Who -- including George Shultz, Jim Mattis and Henry Kissinger. Theranos was the ultimate \"unicorn\" -- the by the venture capitalist Aileen Lee to describe the several dozen software start-ups launched since 2003 and valued at $1 billion or more, companies that avoid the scrutiny of going public while raising vast sums.Belief in the Theranos unicorn split families. Shultz clashed with his grandson, Tyler Shultz, after working at Theranos. It also crossed party lines: President Barack Obama appointed Holmes as a presidential ambassador for global entrepreneurship. Joe Biden called Theranos \"the laboratory of the future.\" Holmes spoke -- with Chelsea Clinton beside her -- at a 2016 fund-raiser for the Clinton campaign.Myth and manipulation turned Holmes into a billionaire. She incarnated America's collective hallucination and corruption, its vertiginous loss of bearings.Theranos collapsed thanks to Carreyrou's . The Security and Exchange Commission charged Holmes with \"massive fraud\" (she settled), and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California indicted her on federal wire fraud and other charges. So much for that unicorn. Brexit, another, endures for now.The unicorn, let's recall, is a legendary creature believed over centuries to exert miraculous powers, particularly through its horn that -- as amulet or powdered -- as a prophylactic or antidote. Leonardo da Vinci wrote that only \"fair maidens\" could appease the unicorn's ferocity. The unicorn never existed. It was collective fantasy. That did not make belief in it less tenacious.We now have a full accounting of the unicorn-in-chief's world. I fear he still has America in his thrall."},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/world/europe/notre-dame-fire-safety.html", "title": "Notre-Dame's Safety Planners Underestimated the Risk, With Devastating Results", "authors": "Katrin Bennhold, James Glanz", "contents": "PARIS -- The architect who oversaw the design of the fire safety system at Notre-Dame acknowledged that officials had misjudged how quickly a flame would ignite and spread through the cathedral, resulting in a much more devastating blaze than they had anticipated.The system was based on the assumption that if the cathedral ever caught fire, the ancient oak timbers in the attic would burn slowly, leaving ample time to fight the flames, said Benjamin Mouton, the architect who oversaw the fire protections.Unlike at sensitive sites in the United States, the fire alarms in Notre-Dame did not notify fire dispatchers right away. Instead, a guard at the cathedral first had to climb a steep set of stairs to the attic -- a trip Mr. Mouton said would take a \"fit\" person six minutes.Only after a blaze was discovered could the fire department be notified and deployed. That means even a flawless response had a built-in delay of about 20 minutes -- from the moment the alarm sounded until firefighters could arrive and climb to the attic with hundreds of pounds of hoses and equipment to begin battling a fire.Those delays turned out to be devastating.\"I was stunned by the speed with which the oak in Notre-Dame burned,\" Mr. Mouton said. \"Oak that old can't burn like a match. It's absolutely incomprehensible.\"But fire safety experts said that Mr. Mouton and his team underestimated the risk -- and that the fire response they designed was far too slow to fight a blaze in time.\"It doesn't make any sense,\" said Jonathan Barnett, a fire safety authority at Basic Expert in Australia. \"Twenty minutes is a huge delay before you get people involved. Once that heavy timber starts to burn, you can't put it out. So I have no idea why they built in this delay.\"Guards responding to a fire alarm at Notre-Dame had to climb a steep set of stairs and check for a fire before they could notify the fire department.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.By Evan Grothjan, Karthik Patanjali and Elian PeltierFrancois Chatillon, a senior architect involved in numerous restorations of France's historic monuments, also stressed that the intense fire risk in the oak timbers underneath Notre-Dame's lead roof was well known.Once lit, he said, \"It is like throwing a match in a matchbox, it's impossible to put out.\"For him the surprise was not that Notre-Dame burned this week, but \"that it didn't burn before.\"Mr. Mouton and his team were not solely responsible for all the decisions made to secure a monument as precious as Notre-Dame. At a minimum, their plans required approval up the chain at the Culture Ministry.Charlotte Hubert, who presides at the same group of chief architects in charge of historical monuments that Mr. Mouton belongs to, underscored that security at such buildings was tightly regulated.\"The chief architect isn't handed the keys and left to do exactly as he wants,\" Ms. Hubert said.Still, fire experts said that two of the top officials on the project, Mr. Mouton and a former firefighter, Lt. Col. Regis Prunet, appeared to have miscalculated what was needed to protect such an unusual, complex and irreplaceable building from a fire.Scientists consulted by The New York Times said fire dynamics indicated that, while the dense timbers may take time to burn completely, a fire would naturally race across the original timbers at Notre-Dame. It was a mistake to assume otherwise, they said.Mr. Mouton was the architect in charge of Notre-Dame between 2000 and 2013, and in that position he oversaw a revamp of fire safety.\"The issue of fire safety was brought up as soon as I arrived,\" he said. \"I managed the issue from beginning to end.\"Mr. Prunet, the former firefighter, became fire safety adviser at the Culture Ministry and worked with Mr. Mouton and his team.The two men faced a monumental task. There was no proper fire protection plan in place, not even a plan to evacuate tourists or worshipers in case of a blaze, Mr. Prunet said in a separate interview. It was a miracle that nothing had happened before, he said, and \"a great irony\" that it should happen so soon after a plan was put in place.Both Mr. Mouton and Mr. Prunet said they had been given a free hand to design the most effective fire protection system. Money was not an issue.When the budget came in higher than expected, the authorities found the money and merely stretched the number of years to put the plan in place, to four from two, Mr. Mouton said.\"The project was not downsized because of financial considerations, I can absolutely guarantee that,\" he said.But even if no cost was spared, there was also a conservative approach to preserving the historic wooden structure in its unadulterated form. The designers were determined not to alter the attic with protective measures like sprinklers or fire walls.A willingness to sacrifice its pristine state for a compromise between what was possible 850 years ago and what is sensible today could have saved the spire, experts said.Firewall technology was used elsewhere in the cathedral -- but not in the attic. Mr. Prunet said the scale and complexity of the attic structure at Notre-Dame was of a different order.The cathedral was all but assured to go up in flames.\"In Notre-Dame it was very complicated because the oak beams were entangled with each other in what we call the forest,\" Mr. Prunet said.But the main reason to opt against fire walls, Mr. Mouton said, was because it risked \"mutilating\" the structure.\"It's true,\" he said, that the idea had been floated at the time, \"but it was discarded.\"\"It changes the appearance but also the elements, because to put up a partition you need to cut the wood. It's mutilating,\" Mr. Mouton said.Mr. Prunet added that sprinklers were not added because they would \"drown the whole structure.\"Instead, they said, the team had banked on prevention and detection. This was a conscious choice.Two guards were on site to monitor the delicate roof structure, day and night, like a bank vault. The cathedral was covered in smoke and heat sensors. Three times a day someone went up to check that the system was working.Mr. Mouton said he performed a trial of the time it took for a guard to investigate an alert, racing one of his guards to the top of the attic.''It does take a certain amount of time, including for someone who is very fit,\" he said. \"That solution seemed reasonable to me, considering that it's old oak and doesn't burn like that.\"Beyond that assumption, the alert system appears to have been flawed, too, beginning with the response to the first alarm at 6:20 p.m.The guard, seeing no obvious fire, gave the all-clear and came down.But when an alarm goes off, it is imperative to identify which alarm it was -- and why -- including whether a malfunction or an insect crawled into the apparatus, said Glenn Corbett, an associate professor of fire science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\"There wasn't an adequate investigation of that first alarm,\" Mr. Corbett said. \"That was probably the biggest mistake they made.\"At that point, presumably, a smoldering fire somewhere in the attic had begun to spread, though how the fire started has yet to be determined.Fire safety experts struggled to understand how Mr. Mouton came to believe that fire would spread slowly in old hardwood.Mr. Corbett said that in long-discredited lore, fires in heavy timber buildings dating to the 19th century were sometimes referred to as \"slow burning.\"Mr. Barnett, the Australian expert, underscored that the time it takes a fire to burn a piece of thick timber completely is entirely different from calculating how quickly a fire will spread.\"He miscalculated the large surface area,\" Mr. Barnett said. \"There's lots of energy and it's spreading very quickly.\"By the time the second alarm sounded at 6:43 p.m. and a guard climbed the stairs again, the fire was already a conflagration.The call finally went to the fire brigade at 6:51 p.m.\"We could have avoided all this with a modern detection system,\" said Guillaume Poitrinal, president of Fondation du Patrimoine, an organization that promotes French architectural heritage.The early detection technology was an aspirating smoke detection system provided by Siemens in 2013, but the company said it had not been given a service contract and could not speak to possible operational questions.Fire alarms in France never automatically alert the fire department, a spokesman for the Paris Fire Brigade confirmed.\"There can be false alarms, that's why the firefighters ask that someone go check,\" said Gabriel Plus, the spokesman. He called this \"removal of doubt.\"But outside experts suggested that in the case of Notre-Dame, the choices in the fire safety design did not leave enough time for that.There would have been one other solution: A permanent presence of firefighters on site. Buildings that run \"a significant risk\" in case of a fire, Mr. Plus said, sometimes get such a presence, among them the Louvre, the Paris court, the National Assembly and the National Library.Notre Dame, he said, was not in this category.Mr. Mouton acknowledged that firefighters on standby would have been the only reliable way to ensure against fire damage, but he said this would not have been justified when \"there are fires going off everywhere in Paris and in the suburbs.\"Some risk had to be accepted, he said. \"All things are relative.\"\"I am very troubled by what has happened,\" Mr. Mouton said.Would he design the system differently today, knowing what he knows now?\"The detection system would have been the same,\" he said, \"but the response system would have changed.\"\"Of course it's the first minutes that count,\" he said, pausing. Then he added: \"After the fact, one is always wrong and could have done better.\""},

But that didn't stop her from getting on stage in high-heeled boots and taping a stand-up special for Netflix.\"I throw up an 'Exorcist' amount every day,\" said Schumer, who has an extreme form of nausea and vomiting called hyperemesis.\"If you had a good pregnancy, like if you're someone who enjoyed being pregnant,\" she said, putting her hand over her heart, \"I just hope your car flips over.\"Men have dominated stand-up comedy since before the days of Jack Benny. But as women have elbowed their way onto the stage more often, one kind of performance has been hard not to notice: pregnant comedians popping up on high-profile comedy specials, late-night shows, and in clubs.No longer seen as something vaguely unhip that gets in the way of the act and the microphone stand, a baby on the way is now a rich source of stand-up material: stretch marks, placentas and all., who has done two Netflix specials while pregnant, explained clogged ducts, lactation consultants and diapers -- for mom. (After the baby comes out, \"You know what else exits? Her house.\")Schumer lifted up her dress during her special, \"Growing,\" to show the bandages over her belly button trying to keep it flat., clearly pregnant under a rainbow sequined dress, cataloged the reasons she did not want children. (\"Does anyone else have people in their family that you don't want to make more of? I have a brother who lives in a van that he put an address on.\")And , comfortably into her third trimester, cheerfully mimed along while talking about masturbation.Just a few years ago, said Pazsitzky, who performs as Christina P., \"We were sort of hidden, it was considered not cool.\"\"When I got pregnant with my second child, things had definitely changed,\" she said. \"The managers and agents were all like: 'Cha-Ching! Cha-Ching! Where's the book deal? Where's the special?'\"Such performances would have been hard to imagine when the grande dame of American comedy, Joan Rivers, appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1967, while carrying her daughter, Melissa.\"I wasn't allowed to say I was pregnant,\" Rivers, , said in a 2007 interview. \"I was in a tent,\" she added of her poofy dress, \"and I had to say, 'soon I'll hear the pitter-patter of little feet.'\"Just four years ago, , a comedian and the host of NPR's trivia and comedy show, \"Ask Me Another,\" said that some bookers had warned her that she might alienate her audience by talking about her pregnancy on stage.\"For years we've heard men talk about their penises,\" she said, \"and we were supposed to accept that that's universal!\"And today? Forget the pitter-patter.\"All the questions everyone asks -- What are you having? Do you know what you're having?\" Schumer said in her Netflix special.Her answer: \"Hemorrhoids!\"So how did we get here?There is no comprehensive count of women in comedy, but comedians, club owners and bookers say there are more of them working today, even though they remain vastly outnumbered by men. And with women starting families later than they used to, these female comics are now more likely to have established careers by the time they start having babies.\"My peers and I kind of hit it, so to speak, just as you're right at the end of your fertility window,\" Pazsitzky, whose children are 9 months old and 3, said. \"I've worked 15 years to get here.\"Like most working women, she said, \"I can't take a year off to have a baby.\"So there they are, with an audience and microphone, and a whole lot of material.Wong: \"Breast-feeding is this savage ritual that just reminds you that your body is a cafeteria now.\"Leggero: \"The amount of weight I've gained, I'm not really in the glowing stage. I'm kind of in the what's-Natasha-sad-about stage.\"Schumer: \"I didn't throw up today!\"They were glad, they said, to have somewhere to channel the sci-fi surprises that come with growing a human.\"I think the first time I said it onstage was at a college, and they just seemed horrified,\" Leggero said of announcing her pregnancy to an audience. \"I was so excited to try the stuff because I had ideas and jokes I wanted to talk about. But they probably weren't the exact right crowd.\"As each passing trimester inspires new lines, some have to go. , a stand-up in Los Angeles who gave birth to her daughter this month (welcome, Rosalie!), said she had to lose a joke in which she explained to political conservatives how birth control worked, because she no longer looked like she had a vise grip on it herself.But she did keep a bit where she gets super low to the ground in a deep squat, imitating a very tiny person.\"Throughout the entire pregnancy, but in stand-up too, people treat you like you're very fragile,\" she said. \"I could feel the audience going like, 'Oooh, is she O.K., this precious glass figurine?' It's O.K.! I wouldn't do it if it wasn't okay.\"For women who have difficult pregnancies, the travel often required for stand-up can be a real challenge. In February, Schumer the remainder of her tour, saying that because of her hyperemesis she was no longer allowed to fly. \"I wanted to push through and do my shows,\" she posted on Instagram. \"Because I hate letting people down and I love stand up and money! But more than that I have to think about my health and the baby.\"Many comics, however, said there were advantages to plus-one performances.\"Anything remotely vulgar gets a bigger laugh when you're pregnant,\" Pazsitzky said. \"It's just more taboo. Any inappropriate hand gestures or obscene phrases are real crowd pleasers.\"Audiences can also be easier to win over. The comedian Bonnie McFarlane, whose daughter is now 11, said that she is heckled approximately every single show, but when she was visibly pregnant, she was heckled just once.She recalled: \"A woman said to me, 'I don't think you're really pregnant, I think you're just fat.'\"As fun as it can be to play with expectations about maternal behavior and delicate pregnant ladies, many comics look forward to the day that an expectant mom on stage is not unusual at all.\"When you are pregnant, you are very loudly a woman,\" said Jenny Hagel, a comedian and writer for \"Late Night With Seth Meyers,\" who did improv at New York City's Upright Citizens Brigade Theater until two weeks before her son was born. \"And we are programmed in our society that it is less appropriate for women to make jokes than it is for men.\"Then again, she added: \"Man-buns are normal now. We can get used to anything with conditioning.\""},

What will its name be? The shortest odds were on (1) this week and (2) Diana.But isn't it kind of icky to put money down on a woman's pregnancy? Even if that woman is Meghan Markle, arguably the most famous American in Britain, and definitely the best-known actress turned duchess there? Even if the baby is a Royal Baby?\"The idea of tens of thousands of strangers voting on the sex of your unborn baby is frankly bizarre, but it's part of the buildup to a royal birth and an acceptable part of the narrative,\" said Katie Nicholl, who comments on the royals for a living and wrote a book titled \"Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss, and Love.\"She added: \"It's generally seen as harmless fun, and an age-old tradition that's synonymous with royal births.\"It's also a chance to make a lot of money off a newborn. of Prince Harry and Ms. Markle -- now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- was popular with gamblers.There were guesses about her dress (Givenchy), his beard (intact) and the weather (lovely).But there are far more bets on Baby Sussex, who will be seventh in line to the throne. At the bookmaker William Hill, wagers are expected to reach $1.3 million. Another bookmaker, Boyle Sports, is taking bets on categories like the baby's godparents and weight.That's more action than for each of the baby's three royal cousins -- the children ofCatherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William, Prince Harry's brother -- who are third through fifth .On the BookMaker.eu website, odds favor the baby's being born in the morning on a Sunday, said Angus Hamilton, an entertainment specialist for the sports betting platform, who remembers similar wagers being placed when Princess Diana was pregnant.The betting market for royal babies is not enormous, Mr. Hamilton said. On BookMaker.eu, there is less than $100,000 in related wagers, compared with the $1 million in bets that the Oscars sometimes draw on the day of the ceremony.\"It's not college basketball or the Super Bowl, but it's a bit of fun,\" he said. \"Royal babies are big news in the U.K., but people are excited about this one in particular.\"That's why Tilletts, a jeweler in Norwich, is marking the birth by charging $5,500 for a jar of diaper rash cream. The lid is made of silver, engraved with the British and American flags and set with diamonds, inspired by \"the sparkling warmth and charm of Meghan's personality,\" according to the company.The proceeds will be sent to Ickle Pickles, a charity that provides intensive care equipment for premature babies.Baby Sussex is expected to be an economic stimulus for British pubs, restaurants, souvenir shops and museums, with an uptick in tourists, especially from the United States, said Richard Haigh, the managing director of Brand Finance, a consulting firm. Last year, it estimated that the Sussex wedding fueled $1.5 billion in spending.Immediately after the birth, sales of memorabilia and other baby-related products could reach nearly $100 million in Britain and the rest of Europe, with some related spending in North America, according to the Center for Retail Research in Norwich.Stores in Britain have already geared up for a boom in baby-related spending. a London company specializing in iced cookies, is marking Baby Sussex's birth with a luxury biscuit tin of decorated sweet treats featuring crowns and baby onesies that customers can buy for 45 pounds, or about $59.Sophie Allport, a British housewares brand, adorned with American flags and Union Jacks. The baby's name and date of birth will be applied to the inside rim of the mugs and delivered to customers after the birth.Not on the High Street, an online gifts retailer, is making the most of the regal fanfare by putting together a page of \"Royal-Baby-Worthy\" gifts that it says will have babies feeling \"like royalty.\"Brands will also be keeping an eye out to see if Baby Sussex makes , the kind of endorsement that can clear stores out of .\"From the day the pregnancy is announced, we see an increasing flow of traffic to the website and noticeable demand and searches online for classic and vintage-inspired clothing,\" said Pepa Gonzalez, founder of Pepa & Company. Her company made the outfits worn by the pageboy and flower girl at the 2017 wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister.In the child's first five years, the Center for Retail Research expects nearly $800 million in spending on Sussex-inspired children's wear and infant products. In the first two years, more than $130 million of those purchases will come from the United States.The Sussexes have had a complicated relationship with public attention and have opted to shun after the birth. In the past, these first moments in the glare of the press have also given the and adorning the mother and baby unparalleled publicity on newspaper front pages.But Ms. Markle will not be in seclusion. In the waning weeks of the pregnancy, the Sussexes started an Instagram account, which they used to ask well-wishers to donate to charities rather than send baby gifts. The account garnered a million followers in less than six hours, far faster than the previous record holders: Pope Francis and the K-pop star Kang Daniel, according to Guinness World Records."},

So a team of eight club staffers gets busy under his direction, pulling a potted plant from the terrace for one corner and setting up two dozen glowing amber votive candles. Mr. Ford himself redoes the white flowers, plucking out the roses and leaving in the ranunculus, because he doesn't like mixed blooms.The Murphy bed he can do nothing about.As I enter, the designer is lost in thought, still fantasizing about redoing the room in his own preferred palette, draping chocolate brown velvet on the walls.Everything in life can always be more sensual and beautiful, if you think about it. And Mr. Ford is always thinking about it.From the time he was big enough to push furniture, at 6 years old, he was rearranging it in his house, sometimes swapping his for his sister's. And giving his mother critiques on her hair and shoes.And that's why being Tom Ford is awful, in a way.He always sees what's wrong. And you can't help but feel bad for him because you know his flawless flaw detector is always on.\"I am a hyper-hyper Virgo,\" he said. \"Perfectionist, anal-retentive, supposedly. Seemingly uptight, seemingly aloof. We're definitely homebodies also. We love the home.\" (Or in his case, six.)Mr. Ford has been known to go to a movie in the middle of the day wearing a suit, and to make hospital corners with other people's slipcovers.\"I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse, but he actually can make things better,\" said the actress Rita Wilson, a friend. \"He's not afraid to say you need to cut three inches off your hair or lose weight.\"Even on vacations in the tropics or river rafting, she said, Mr. Ford looks eerily perfect. He used to tailor white T-shirts he bought at La Rinascente in Milan, but now he wears his own brand. \"The cut of the sleeve has to be just right if you want your biceps to look right,\" he said.In 2003, as the creative director of Gucci, he personally shaved a \"G\" in a model's pubic hair for an ad, adding definition with an eyebrow pencil.Lisa Eisner, who has done jewelry collaborations with Mr. Ford and inspired the Alessia character in his 2016 film, \",\" said that he doesn't expect everyone to be as persnickety as he is.\"At Graydon Carter's wedding, I drank way too much and ran out to go to the bathroom and got sick on his shoes -- really good Tom Ford shoes,\" she recalled. \"He just laughed and wiped it off.\" And his friends praise his fierce loyalty.Ms. Wilson recalled that after her breast cancer diagnosis in 2015, when she had to present at the Tonys feeling vulnerable because \"you have had part of your body removed,\" Mr. Ford designed her a beautiful dress to wear that \"made my shape look like a normal shape. And he did it with such sensitivity, generosity and love.\"Mr. Ford did not check his phone during the three hours we spent together. He has perfect posture and lovely Southern manners and stands up when you return to the table from the bathroom. His voice, as one fan wrote in a YouTube comment, sounds like what melted chocolate tastes like. Admiring the votives' golden aura, I confessed that I'm obsessed with lighting and have been known to unscrew bulbs in restaurant booths or flip off lights at parties.\"Oh, I do that,\" Mr. Ford said. \"At Tower Bar, if you go to my table, the corner table at the back, there are these overhead spots and on mine it's blacked out, because I told them, 'You have to get rid of that spot or I'm not going to come here. No overhead lights.'\"Jeff Klein, Mr. Ford's friend who is the hotelier behind both the bungalows and the Sunset Tower hotel where the Tower Bar is, called an electrician to put in a special switch for Mr. Ford's table, which can be flipped off when he's on his way.\"Why, oh my God, overhead light,\" Mr. Ford continued, warming to the subject, \"where your brow is going to create shadow right there, your nose is going to create a shadow like this, you look like hell, you look like you have no hair, even if you have a lot of hair. Nobody looks good in overhead lighting.\"That's why I don't go to Barry and Diane's lunch party,\" he confided, referring to one of the most coveted invitations in Hollywood, on Oscar weekend at the Coldwater Canyon mansion of and Diane von Furstenberg. \"I don't like the middle of the day. Take a picture at noon, anywhere in the world. You're going to look like hell -- Everybody looks like hell. Unless you're 18, maybe, or under. Even then you don't look your best. I like daylight, but not to go out in public.\"Mr. Ford cloaks himself in black, planted a black garden in London of black tulips and black calla lilies, contemplates death constantly and plans on designing a black sarcophagus. He is 57 but for decades has not seemed to get any older. And he's wearing Beau de Jour (one of 39 Tom Ford fragrances), a scent meant to evoke the allure of Cary Grant's neck.I told him that all this makes him a member of my favorite cult: sexy vampires.His face lit up. \"A vampire cape was one of the first things I got when I could tell my mother to make something for me, and it was black satin on the outside and red satin on the inside,\" he said. \"And I had the vampire teeth and I had the LP with the music from 'Dark Shadows.' I was obsessed and I wanted to be a vampire because vampires are sexy. They don't age. Talk about seductive. I'm not talking about Nosferatu, you know. But vampires were usually rich, they lived in a fabulous house or castle. Wore black. Vampires are great.\"Ms. Eisner demurred: \"Tom smells too good to be a vampire.\" She said that those who know Mr. Ford simply through the famous shots of him with naked models and actresses probably think he's \"a sex pervert, someone who thinks about sex 24-7. Nope, he's not that guy at all. He's very loyal to his friends. Very married.\"Richard Buckley, Mr. Ford's husband since 2013, confirmed that the facade of gleaming black lacquer is deceiving.\"The one misconception I think most people have of Tom is that he is some kind of press whore who loves to have his picture taken,\" said Mr. Buckley, a longtime fashion journalist with whom Mr. Ford had a coup de foudre during an elevator ride 32 years ago. \"He is, and always has been, shy,\" Mr. Buckley said. \"He did acting when he was in his early 20s, so he is able to 'turn on' for interviews.\" Referring to their 6-year-old son, he added: \"And Jack has never been photographed. In London, we have a court injunction to keep any newspaper or magazine from running pictures of him. In Los Angeles, there is a law.\" (The designer takes Jack -- who already prefers black despite drawers filled with colorful clothes -- every day to school, where \"the mothers have to see Tom Ford looking great at 8 in the morning while they look like hell,\" an amused Ms. Eisner noted.)Mr. Buckley, 70, said dryly that their lives are not \"all champagne and caviar,\" opening up about his nightmarish struggle with the aftereffects of radiation for the throat cancer for which he had surgery for in 1989, three years after the men became involved.\"Tom has seen me through so much, from throat cancer to my brother and mother dying 48 hours apart, to more bouts of pneumonia than I can count,\" Mr. Buckley said.Mr. Ford made his husband gray merino wool turtleneck dickeys with keyhole slits for his tracheotomy tube, and, for formal events, a black silk scarf with slits.\"Tom is actually quite good at sewing,\" Mr. Buckley said. (These days, a designer need not be.)Recently, it was announced that Mr. Ford will succeed Ms. von Furstenberg as the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, a job he was persuaded to take by her and Anna Wintour.\"He's a cross between a Rolls-Royce and the Marlboro Man,\" Ms. von Furstenberg told me. At a time when Donald Trump's America is turning away from the rest of the world, Mr. Ford, who has spent half his life working and studying in Europe, says he will reach out because \"if American fashion is going to flourish, it has got to drop the idea that it's American fashion and become global.\"\"It's a turbulent time in some ways for fashion, which has been rightly criticized for its lack of inclusivity, for not having enough women in C.E.O. positions,\" Ms. Wintour said. \"These are things Tom cares about.\"Indeed, back in the Gucci days, Mr. Ford was one of the first designers to prominently feature African-American and Asian models on the runway and in ad campaigns. said that Mr. Ford stands out because he's \"not like most of the cruel snakes in fashion and in cutthroat business. His is an unapologetic universe of sultry, melting-pot sexuality, often fusing or blurring the genders.\"Virgil Abloh, the creator of Off-White and the artistic director of men's wear at Louis Vuitton, said that, at the C.F.D.A., Mr. Ford will not be \"just a puppet of the industry going with the flow. He has rigor in his work and his personality, and he will bring challenging ideas.\"Mr. Abloh said that Mr. Ford's provocative Gucci ads inspired him when he was a teenager in Illinois, into skateboarding, hip-hop and normcore. \"I was an outsider,\" he said, \"and he made me believe in fashion.\"Women's Wear Daily that Mr. Ford was the buyer, for $18 million, of the Paul Rudolph modernist four-story townhouse on 63rd Street in Manhattan where Halston once lived, hosting some of the wildest parties of the 1970s (Mr. Ford's favorite decade) for glitterati like Truman Capote, Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Liza Minnelli.In Los Angeles, Mr. Ford lives in a $39 million Holmby Hills mansion, formerly owned by Betsy Bloomingdale, that is a study in black and white, complete with a Scottish butler named Angus. He also has property in Santa Fe, where his family moved when he was 11, including a $75 million ranch, which he's selling, that includes a Western movie town used to shoot such movies as \"Cowboys and Aliens\" and \"All the Pretty Horses.\" When a colleague told him that the Rudolph place had been on sale for eight years, he snapped it up.\"I've kind of lived in that house in my mind for many years,\" Mr. Ford said. \"It has dark brown glass, it has a garage, it has a .\" There are 32-foot-high ceilings, skylights galore and a roof garden. New York had long seemed stressful. \"It felt like all work, if I walked down the street and somebody saw me, they would get on the phone and call so-and-so and then so-and-so would say, 'You need to come to my party,' and 'You need to go to her opening,' and 'So-and-so needs to see you,' and it just wasn't fun.\"But then he thought about his son. \"I love L.A.,\" he said, \"but I do want Jack to know how to put on a jacket, go to a restaurant, go to a museum, walk on the street, go to a play.\"Mr. Ford first visited his new house in the heyday of Studio 54, which is where, after years of dating women, he realized he was gay.He was studying art history in his freshman dorm room one night, feeling disoriented about the move to New York. \"I just said, 'Oh my God, please, please, please let something happen to me.' Knock, knock, knock. I went to the door and there was Ian Falconer, this guy from art history class, in a little blue blazer, and he said, 'Do you want to go to Studio?' And I said, 'Are you kidding me, Studio 54?' And he said, 'Yeah, I'm going with some friends.'\"One of the friends was Andy Warhol, who picked them up in a Cadillac limousine. \"The stretch Cadillacs were fabulous. There were two jump seats in the back. And it was literally like a movie, everyone got pushed aside and we walked right in the door. 'Oh my God, here I am, Studio 54 for the very first time' and I drank a lot, did a lot of coke.\"Even back then, he always visualized the sort of cinematic life he has now, with several Warhols on the wall, including a triptych of vulvas and a \"Big Electric Chair.\" He sold a fright-wig self-portrait of the artist at Sotheby's for $32.6 million to pay for his stores in China.That night at Studio 54 was the first night he ended up with a man, and it \"freaked\" him out. \"And I said to him, 'This was great but this isn't really what I do or who I am' and I went back to my dorm room. And I tried to sort of deny that, and then I remember friends that were gay saying, 'Why are you dating a girl? You're really gay.' I suppose I struggled with it for maybe six months. Maybe it was coming from my family background in Texas where, you know, guys are guys. I was nervous about telling my parents, but they're liberal Democrats who met at the University of Texas and it was pre-AIDS and they were totally cool with it.\" (His parents were real estate agents.)\"And I learned later on that it was a plus because people thought if you weren't gay, you couldn't possibly be a good designer.\"Tom Ford is elegantly dressed, naturally, all in Tom Ford: a black double 002 watch with a removable woven leather band; a white cotton French cuff shirt (\"because it's one of the only things a man can have, a pair of cuff links\"); trousers, plain-weave; the black velvet peak lapel jacket favored by Hollywood moguls; and a pair of black cap-toe Chelsea boots. Men in Los Angeles never wear the proper shoes, in his opinion.\"I don't feel secure in a slip-on or a tennis shoe,\" he said. \"I think it's the Texan in me. I could never go to a business meeting in a tennis shoe. You feel soft, bouncy, not in control. I don't feel good in sweaters either, when I'm out. I feel soft and mushy and vulnerable. I need my armor.\"What about that time in St. Barts when he was nude on the beach and Anna Wintour happened to walk by?A talented mimic, Mr. Ford describes the awkward moment: \"'Hi, Richard. Hi, Tom.' And I'm like, 'Oh, hi, Anna!' Oh, I'm naked! It was a wake-up call.\"(When I asked Ms. Wintour about it, she answered breezily: \"Everyone was naked in St. Barts in those days. And it happened, I'm sure Tom looked as perfect as he always does.\")Politicians also need their armor, and Mr. Ford, who toggles from Turner Classic Movies to MSNBC to CNN to the BBC, was happy to muse about makeovers for them.On Hillary Clinton: \"I supported Hillary but when she talks to a camera she lifts her chin and all of the sudden, it's a haughty pose. Now Princess Diana, when she answered a question, she would look up at you from underneath doe eyes, which made you go, 'awww.'\"On Elizabeth Warren: \"She needs shoulder pads!\"On Kamala Harris: \"She looks great.\"On Pete Buttigieg: \"I started thinking of advice for Mayor Pete and Chasten, but then I realized what's so great about them is that they're so natural.\"On President Trump: \"He's a very tall man, but he's also not the slimmest thing. The elongated ties, it's one more vertical that could, in his head, make him feel slimmer. He also never buttons his jacket, which I find very odd. I've run around rooms at a party buttoning people's jackets because it gives you a waist.\" And what about the time Mr. Trump Scotch-taped the back of his tie? \"Well, Scotch tape a miracle,\" Mr. Ford allowed.He was drinking a Coke with his grilled artichoke and cauliflower steak, having become vegan, allowing himself the occasional piece of salmon, after watching the documentary \"What the Health.\" He cheats with baked goods, jelly beans, Starbursts and Skittles. \"Sugar is my weakness,\" he said. He weighs himself daily, holding at 165 pounds, and hasn't had a drink for 10 years.\"For several years leading up to stopping drinking -- because I drank a lot -- on the mornings after, I would have to send flowers to this one and flowers to that one and, 'Oh, I can't believe I did that' and 'I can't believe I said that,' and I told Richard for at least a year, 'Oh my God, I wish I could just not drink at all.' And the drinking was the open door for the drugs.

Because it was lunch and I was just kicking back the vodka tonics and I didn't think anything of it. It was the first indication I had that, 'oh, maybe this isn't normal.'\"He worked with a therapist for a year, tapered off and then one weekend just stopped. Mr. Ford's critically acclaimed movies, \"Nocturnal Animals\" and \"A Single Man\" (2009), are so drenched in color that they bring to mind the mesmerizing luminosities of Venetian painting.\"I don't allow the cinematographer to see the film until I'm finished with it because I have very specific ideas and I sit there, frame by frame, on the computer and color-correct every scene,\" Mr. Ford said. \"And I have the ability to take those mandarin oranges and pop them and then desaturate the rest of the image. And you can manipulate the colors, so it is really like painting.\"He had a new film deal fall apart on him last summer, and he has just bought the rights to a 600-page book he won't name but has been wanted to adapt for 12 years.Naturally, he's looking for more control. \"In fashion, we would never design something and then hand it off to somebody else to advertise it,\" he pointed out. \"All movie trailers sound the same and look the same. I guess what I've learned is that there's this sort of myth that it's a magic thing that only professionals know how to do and I just don't buy into that anymore because I feel like I know how to do it better.\"I was surprised to learn he has an aversion to color in his clothes and homes. He tried some, aside from the art, in his Santa Fe home but quickly backtracked because it was too \"challenging.\" He even painted the bright yellow tractors on the ranch black, to go along with his black Angus cattle, black horses and black backhoes.\"I don't like color on me because I don't like to scream, I like to recede in a way,\" he said. \"I was always shy and so I would feel silly in a bright color.\"He said he feels enormous empathy for women who get frightened about their looks fading. \"There's nothing more powerful in our culture than a beautiful woman,\" he said.

I was shooting an ad campaign last week, and the guy came up behind the girl and was kissing her on the neck and he was holding her wrists from the back and I said, 'No, no, we have to change that.

One of my assistants went out with Terry for two years and he was the kindest, gentlest person in the relationship.\"I wondered about the fracases over cultural appropriation. \"Two shows ago, I showed the girls with scarves on their head, which were not and that was not where that idea came from,\" he said, adding that it came from the '70s, which I know to be true, because I wore them in college. \"And a couple of people wrote that it was durags and appropriation.

You're celebrating it.\"After we split a lemon meringue pie, the designer dropped me at my hotel in his chauffeured Range Rover. The next day I flew home.

That liquefied grape jelly was our house wine, and she served it every week on the Sabbath and on every holiday.Even after I stopped observing Sabbath rules myself, and made my professional life in wine, my mother could never quite grasp my desperation to find something palatable for Passover. Each year, I'd plunk down way too much money, hopes high, expectations low, ferrying the rabbi-approved bottles over to Mom's apartment in Long Beach. Somewhere around the second cup, Ethel would ask, \"You know what this needs?\" and mix some of her sweet Concord with the $35 kosher Burgundy I'd brought.I was brought up in a kosher and fairly observant household, and attended 12 years of religious school. I was raised to go to the women's college at Yeshiva University, not Stony Brook, and I certainly wasn't supposed become a wine writer. But I did both of those things. And almost 20 years ago, I dedicated myself to the cause of natural wine: organic viticulture with none of the more than 70 legal additives -- things like yeast, bacteria, tannin, acid, anti-foaming agents and wood chips -- that may be present in most wines, kosher or otherwise. The secular bottles I drink are mostly made from one ingredient: grapes. Natural wine is unpredictable. It boasts a huge variation in flavors. The winemaker's goal is to translate the place the grapes come from into the glass, and each bottle carries an imprint of what happened the year it was made. These wines bear no resemblance to conventional or kosher wines that often follow a cookie-cutter path, full of additives to get them there. Those wines are not ones I want to sip at the holiday or any table.Not long ago, that only my kind of wine is fit for the Eucharist. Which leads to the fifth question of my Passover celebration: Why, on this night, am I unable to find any kosher natural wines?Well, I should say that there are two worthy options, both made in minute amounts: Harkham from Australia and Camuna in Berkeley, Calif. There should be more. Before World War II, before the boom in the use of additives, most wines were natural or natural enough. Jewish winemakers and vineyard owners produced kosher wine, most famously in Hungary, where winemaking families like the sflourished. The Holocaust destroyed that heritage.My Yiddish-speaking grandfather, who was born in Ukraine in the 19th century, did remember this natural wine tradition. He made wine in our basement. One of my earliest memories of Pop, who taught me to smell everything before I drank it, was his despairing over a batch of his wine that had turned to vinegar. When it worked though, it was delicious.Kosher isn't about being blessed; it's about being watched and being handled only by Sabbath observers from ferment to corkscrew -- a rule that was an attempt to protect against wine being used for idolatry.There is one workaround: boiling. Such wines are labeled \"mevushal\" and a pagan (or even a lapsed yeshiva girl like me) can serve any kosher wine that has been boiled, flash-pasteurized or made from heated grapes, to anyone, even the very religious. While modern methods for this technique are far kinder, hot grapes do not make the best wine and prevent natural ferments. That means adding yeasts and nutrients. Anyone who cares about wine will opt for a cocktail instead at religious weddings.But at Passover, it's wine you need, and at my mother's table it needs to be kosher. That's why last year I tried to make my own: traditional, authentic, kosher and natural.This was a deeply personal project. That is, I understood that not that many other people are in the market for natural kosher wine, yet. After all, how can you know what you're missing if it doesn't exist? \"No one cares and no one knows what they want because they don't have the exposure,\" David Raccah, who writes the blog Kosher Wine Musings and drinks only kosher, told me.It was also an expensive and logistically difficult endeavor. Kosher certification can cost up to $10,000 a year.I set out to make my wine in the country of Georgia, since I have written about winemaking there and I knew I could get affordable grapes and work space. I had a religious friend of a friend lined up to handle the wine for me and take my instruction. All I had to do was figure out how to pay for the kosher certification and deal with the bureaucracy.It wasn't easy to reach the rabbi in Tbilisi. He was in constant demand, always rushing out to Kutaisi for a bris or to Bagdati for a wedding.Finally, I got him over Skype. After a long treatise on the religious laws and why I, a now-secular Jewish natural wine lover, would never be able to make my wine, we were disconnected. I called back. Friends in Tbilisi tried to reach him. The harvest of 2018 came and went. His dismissiveness just made me want to do it even more.Making wine is risky. You need the right soil blessed with the right climate. You need talent. And without additives, you need knowledge and a little luck. I have a plan in place and another rabbi lined up for this year. I'm determined to make something that Ethel and her friends can enjoy.Do we ever outgrow our desire for a parent's understanding? Even if there was another decade left, my mother will never quite understand or accept my rejection of religious life. But if she understands why I devoted decades of my life to writing about this magical, enduring symbol of life, culture and humanity, that would suit me even better. But to do that, she needs to be able to drink it.Alice Feiring is the author of \"The Dirty Guide to Wine: Following Flavor From Ground to Glass\" and the forthcoming \"Natural Wine for the People: What It Is, Where to Find It, How to Love It.\""},

The fire that broke out at Notre-Dame this week is a historic event of our times.Monday night, even before the flames had been quenched, while we were still wondering whether the cathedral's two towers would withstand the fire, the incident had already become a symbol -- many symbols. It was a sinister omen of France's decline, some promptly said. , it was a sign of the fragility of Western democracy and civilization.On Tuesday, the environmental activist Greta Thunberg, seeing in the building's embers the image of an incandescent Earth, told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, \"Notre-Dame will be rebuilt,\" and urged the legislators to save the planet, too, by shifting gears to President Emmanuel Macron solemnly declared: \"\" Notre-Dame, he vowed, would be restored within five years. Celebrating the Paris firefighters' heroic work in bringing the blaze under control, , \"The state and public authorities often are criticized. But in moments such as these, the entire nation knows how to organize itself.\"In no time, it seemed, the charred cathedral became a rallying cry for bringing together a fractured country -- a way for France \",\" Mr. Macron said. But how could one not see behind these grand pronouncements that this fire already was obscuring a slower but vaster one that has been burning steadily for months, on occasion literally torching cars and upscale Parisian restaurants? Since November, the so-called Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) have demonstrated throughout the country against the rise in inequalities and the drop in living standards, claiming as well that French democracy is not representative enough. History has a sense of irony. France's most famous monument ignited Monday evening just as Mr. Macron was expected to address the country on television and explain how his government proposed to put out that social brazier. His speech was postponed, understandably, and for a few hours much of France focused its attention on Paris' historic center, which it usually turns over to tourists.But history also is cruel. Only a little bit of information about the government's proposed reforms has been disclosed, and it's difficult to imagine that it will have any of the soothing, much less redemptive, effects the government may have hoped for. If anything, the Macron administration's continued vagueness about major demands -- a wealth tax, greater democratic participation -- suggests that it is still dead-set on reducing deficits and refusing to put pressure on the rich, that it will not bow to the Yellow Vests' demands for fiscal justice. Yet even as the government was whimpering, in effect, that the country's coffers were running low, money came pouring in for a cathedral.In a matter of hours, Francois-Henri Pinault, one of France's wealthiest men, offered 100 million euros to rebuild Notre-Dame; Bernard Arnault, who heads the luxury brand LVMH, offered 200 million. Within less than two days, for the cathedral's reconstruction.A journalist sarcastically asked Philippe Martinez, the leader of a major labor union, whether the flood of donations was evidence of trickle-down economics. \",\" Mr. Martinez answered, adding that the outburst of generosity from French billionaires only exposed the inequalities that divide the country. Such gifts aren't just a private matter; they cost the state, too. For one thing, and certainly in the eyes of some Yellow Vests, these philanthropists are offering only a small fraction of enormous fortunes they have amassed partly by avoiding taxes otherwise needed to fund basic public services. And since their proposed gifts are destined for France's national heritage, the bulk of them could benefit from major tax exemptions -- up to 90 percent were to pass.A number of state bodies also have offered to contribute, drawing on strained budgets. Laurent Wauquiez, who heads both the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region and the conservative party Les Republicains, has offered . Other local governments have followed suit.The rush to rebuild Notre-Dame, however well-intentioned, risks only underscoring the government's slowness in helping the people whose lives, some say, have been ruined by neoliberalism and globalization. France's elites quote Victor Hugo in the name of saving the cathedral he wrote about, apparently forgetting that he also wrote \"Les Miserables.\" It is a sad, and dangerous, signal to be sending. That other, greater, fire still needs putting out.

I'm confident that I'm not the only White House counsel from a past administration to read it with particular attention to the details, less technical, that illuminated the extraordinary challenge within this presidency: the relationship between a president heedless of legal constraints and the government lawyers who answer to the public for the rule of law. This is the importance of Mr. Mueller's account of the struggles between President Trump and his White House counsel, Donald McGahn. We should be grateful for Mr. McGahn's resistance to presidential wrongdoing while appreciating that we may need to reconsider and revise the norms and expectations governing the role of lawyers, and the White House counsel in particular. The president directed Mr. McGahn to fire Mr. Mueller, and Mr. McGahn rightly refused. This is not a case where a president, agitated about a development, reviews his concerns with his counsel and solicits his best advice. Mr. Trump insisted on preposterous claims about conflicts that ostensibly disqualified Mr. Mueller and ordered Mr. McGahn to make sure that the Justice Department removed the special counsel from his post. Mr. Trump's motives were clear: Only three days before, he had learned that an investigation into his possible commission of obstruction had begun.Mr. McGahn had to threaten to resign to stop the president's repeated insistence that he fire Mr. Mueller. Implored by senior White House staff members to stay on the job, he did, knowing he would be working for a president who had attempted to use him to end a federal investigation.When the story of Mr. Trump's order and Mr. McGahn's refusal to follow it became public, the president not only demanded that his White House Counsel deny the report. He also insisted on the creation of a false official record to substantiate the lie. He also had a staff secretary, Rob Porter, advise Mr. McGahn that he would be fired if he didn't do what the president wanted. Once again, Mr. McGahn refused to comply.The president called his lawyer a \"lying bastard\" but did not move to replace him. To say that this was an unhealthy relationship between a president and his White House counsel is an understatement. But the institutional issues are still more serious.For some time, there has been an active debate about whether the position of White House counsel is even viable. Critics have condemned it as a nesting place for presidential loyalists with law degrees who will tell the president exactly what he or she wants to hear. There is always the risk of that. The president can pick his own counsel. If he selects for loyalty, then he might suffer the consequences of having a committed political ally if, perhaps, not much of a lawyer. Mr. Trump, in picking Mr. McGahn, did not wind up with a loyalist. Mr. McGahn made it commendably clear to the president that he was an institutional lawyer, not his personal lawyer, and that their conversations about matters before the special counsel were not privileged. But it became clear to him, as it did to James Comey, that the president expected \"loyalty\" higher than any obligation to the public.The conflict over the order to fire Mr. Mueller was not the only occasion on which Mr. McGahn observed the president's indifference to legal limits. He was also aware that in the face of the regulation that made the decision inescapable, the president would not accept Attorney General Jeff Sessions's decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. The president even enlisted Mr. McGahn in the campaign to have Mr. Sessions \"unrecuse.\" Here again, Mr. McGahn relayed the message to the attorney general but did not push Mr. Sessions to reverse course.The episode raises the question of the obligations of a White House counsel when he realizes that he is the lawyer for a fundamentally dishonest president who is ready to violate the criminal law to achieve self-interested or political ends. The counsel in these circumstances may have to consider what it means for him to remain in this post for a president who considers him a \"lying bastard\" for refusing to follow an unlawful order.Mr. McGahn perhaps stayed on in the belief that the larger objectives of the administration, like moving judicial nominations and achieving deregulation, were well worth pursuing. But that is a judgment more about the administration's policy imperatives than the working conditions required for the maintenance of the rule of law in the presidency.The choice Mr. McGahn faced was unprecedented. He was not, for example, in the position of John Dean, White House counsel to Richard Nixon, who did testify against the president in the Watergate affair but who was an original party to the wrongdoing that ended that presidency. There has never been a suggestion that Mr. McGahn ever encouraged or participated in unlawful activities.In fact, Mr. McGahn acted appropriately and admirably to resist involvement in the president's scheme to commit obstruction and cooperated truthfully and at length with Mr. Mueller's investigation. The special counsel declared him a \"credible\" witness with no discernible motive to lie or exaggerate, and accepted his account over the president's denials.But should a future White House counsel have a clear obligation to alert the Department of Justice when the president attempts to obstruct justice? Federal law mandates that department and agency employees alert the attorney general to \"any information\" that relates to \"violations of federal criminal law\" involving government officers and employees. The code of ethics for government service requires reporting of \"corruption\" to the authorities. The application of these requirements to the president's White House counsel poses unique and difficult issues, but they need to be confronted.And what does the discovery of the president's lawless instincts -- or the president's belief that his lawyer is a \"lying bastard\"-- mean for the counsel's continued service? A lawyer in this situation could conclude that he should not serve such a president, or that, lacking a relationship of mutual trust and confidence, he cannot function in the role. Mr. McGahn was stuck working with a president who, pressuring his counsel to end an investigation and fake records about a presidential order, also admonished him for taking notes. \"Lawyers don't take notes,\" he told Mr. McGahn, and Mr. Trump urged on him the role model of Roy Cohn, counsel to Senator Joe McCarthy.This is unexplored ground. In the government of a president like Mr. Trump, a White House counsel faces unprecedented challenges, and we might reflect on options for answering them beyond the threat or act of resignation.

Some 90 percent have seen their incomes stagnate or decline in the past 30 years. This is not surprising, given that the among the advanced countries and one of the lowest levels of opportunity -- with the fortunes of young Americans more dependent on the income and education of their parents than elsewhere.But things don't have to be that way. There is an alternative: progressive capitalism. Progressive capitalism is not an oxymoron; we can indeed channel the power of the market to serve society.In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan's regulatory \"reforms,\" which reduced the ability of government to curb the excesses of the market, were sold as great energizers of the economy. But just the opposite happened: Growth slowed, and weirder still, this happened in the innovation capital of the world.The sugar rush produced by President Trump's largess to corporations in the didn't deal with any of these long-run problems, and is already fading. Growth is expected to be a little under .This is where we've descended to, but not where we have to stay. A progressive capitalism based on an understanding of what gives rise to growth and societal well-being gives us a way out of this quagmire and a way up for our living standards.Standards of living began to improve in the late 18th century for two reasons: the development of science (we learned how to learn about nature and used that knowledge to increase productivity and longevity) and developments in social organization (as a society, we learned how to work together, through institutions like the rule of law, and democracies with checks and balances). Key to both were systems of assessing and verifying the truth. The real and long-lasting danger of the Trump presidency is the risk it poses to these pillars of our economy and society, its attack on the very idea of knowledge and expertise, and its hostility to institutions that help us discover and assess the truth.There is a broader social compact that allows a society to work and prosper together, and that, too, has been fraying. America created the first truly middle-class society; now, a middle-class life is increasingly out of reach for its citizens.America arrived at this sorry state of affairs because we forgot that the true source of the wealth of a nation is the creativity and innovation of its people. One can get rich either by adding to the nation's economic pie or by grabbing a larger share of the pie by exploiting others -- abusing, for instance, market power or informational advantages. We confused the hard work of wealth creation with wealth-grabbing (or, as economists call it, rent-seeking), and too many of our talented young people followed the siren call of getting rich quickly.Beginning with the Reagan era, economic policy played a key role in this dystopia: Just as forces of globalization and technological change were contributing to growing inequality, we adopted policies that worsened societal inequities. Even as economic theories like information economics (dealing with the ever-present situation where information is imperfect), behavioral economics and game theory arose to explain why markets on their own are often not efficient, fair, stable or seemingly rational, we relied more on markets and scaled back social protections. The result is an economy with more exploitation -- whether it's abusive practices in the financial sector or the technology sector using our own data to take advantage of us at the cost of our privacy. The weakening of antitrust enforcement, and the failure of regulation to keep up with changes in our economy and the innovations in creating and leveraging market power, meant that markets became more concentrated and less competitive.Politics has played a big role in the increase in corporate rent-seeking and the accompanying inequality. Markets don't exist in a vacuum; they have to be structured by rules and regulations, and those rules and regulations must be enforced. Deregulation of the financial sector allowed bankers to engage in both excessively risky activities and more exploitive ones. Many economists understood that trade with developing countries would drive down American wages, especially for those with limited skills, and destroy jobs. We could and should have provided more assistance to affected workers (just as we should provide assistance to workers who lose their jobs as a result of technological change), but corporate interests opposed it. A weaker labor market conveniently meant lower labor costs at home to complement the cheap labor businesses employed abroad.We are now in a vicious cycle: Greater economic inequality is leading, in our money-driven political system, to more political inequality, with weaker rules and deregulation causing still more economic inequality.If we don't change course matters will likely grow worse, as machines (artificial intelligence and robots) replace an increasing fraction of routine labor, including many of the jobs of the several million Americans making their living by driving.The prescription follows from the diagnosis: It begins by recognizing the vital role that the state plays in making markets serve society. We need regulations that ensure strong competition without abusive exploitation, realigning the relationship between corporations and the workers they employ and the customers they are supposed to serve. We must be as resolute in combating market power as the corporate sector is in increasing it.If we had curbed exploitation in all of its forms and encouraged wealth creation, we would have had a more dynamic economy with less inequality. We might have curbed the opioid crisis and avoided the 2008 financial crisis. If we had done more to blunt the power of oligopolies and strengthen the power of workers, and if we had held our banks accountable, the sense of powerlessness might not be so pervasive and Americans might have greater trust in our institutions.There are many other areas in which government action is required. Markets on their own won't provide insurance against some of the most important risks we face, such as unemployment and disability. They won't efficiently provide pensions with low administrative costs and insurance against inflation. And they won't provide an adequate infrastructure or a decent education for everyone or engage in sufficient basic research.Progressive capitalism is based on a new social contract between voters and elected officials, between workers and corporations, between rich and poor, and between those with jobs and those who are un- or underemployed. Part of this new social contract is an expanded for many programs now provided by private entities or not at allIt was a mistake not to include the public option in Obamacare: It would have enriched choice and enhanced competition, lowering prices. But one can design public options in other arenas as well, for instance for retirement and mortgages. This new social contract will enable most Americans to once again have a middle-class life.As an economist, I am always asked: Can we afford to provide this middle-class life for most, let alone all, Americans? Somehow, we did when we were a much poorer country in the years after World War II. In our politics, in our labor-market participation, and in our health we are already paying the price for our failures.The neoliberal fantasy that unfettered markets will deliver prosperity to everyone should be put to rest. It is as fatally flawed as the notion after the fall of the Iron Curtain that we were seeing \"the end of history\" and that we would all soon be liberal democracies with capitalist economies.Most important, our exploitive capitalism has shaped who we are as individuals and as a society. The rampant dishonesty we've seen from Wells Fargo and Volkswagen or from members of the Sackler family as they promoted drugs they knew were addictive -- this is what is to be expected in a society that lauds the pursuit of profits as leading, to quote Adam Smith, \"as if by an invisible hand,\" to the well-being of society, with no regard to whether those profits derive from exploitation or wealth creation.Joseph E. Stiglitz () is a university professor at Columbia, the 2001 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, a former chief economist of the World Bank and the author, most recently, of \".\""},

That's not just because of the redactions. When he was hired, Mr. Mueller inherited supervision of an F.B.I. investigation. That is the of the Mueller report.President Trump may claim \"exoneration\" on a narrowly defined criminal coordination charge. But a counterintelligence investigation can yield something even more important: an intelligence assessment of how likely it is that someone -- in this case, the president -- is acting, wittingly or unwittingly, under the influence of or in collaboration with a foreign power. Was Donald Trump a knowing or unknowing Russian asset, used in some capacity to undermine our democracy and national security?The public Mueller report alone provides enough evidence to worry that America's own national security interests may not be guiding American foreign policy.The counterintelligence investigation is not necessarily complete, but from the glimpses we see in the Mueller report, it should set off very serious national security alarm bells.An intelligence assessment makes two determinations: a conclusion about the type of influence a foreign power may have over an individual and the degree of confidence in that conclusion. For example, when Mr. Trump boasted to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the Oval Office that he had fired the F.B.I. director, it raised only the possibility -- a \"circumstantial inference,\" as it's called in counterintelligence -- that the president was wittingly working on behalf of the Russians. This apparent desire to please these officials indicates a high level of Russian influence and, in the context of other actions that pleased Mr. Putin, like his sudden decision to withdraw American troops from Syria -- could support a modest to high level of confidence in that conclusion.But reaching very high confidence that Mr. Trump is wittingly doing Moscow's bidding would require something we don't have and would not expect to have, like an email from Vladimir Putin ordering Mr. Trump to fire the F.B.I. director James Comey.Similarly, there is no \"smoking gun\" order in the incidents below. They indicatea strong influence by the Russians, but only low to moderate confidence that he acted at Russia's behest. There's simply noclear sign that Mr. Trump was following directions of acting under pressure from the Kremlin. The former Trump adviser Roger Stone directly communicates with the Russia-linked actor Guccifer 2.0 and coordinates with WikiLeaks to get Mr. Trump elected -- and he is likely aware that one is a Russian front organization and the other is working with the Russians.A Trump campaign national security adviser is informed by a Russian intelligence operative that the Kremlin has stolen Hillary Clinton-related emails and could assist the Trump campaign through \"anonymous release\" of derogatory information; the campaign then works on setting up backdoor meetings with senior Russian government officials (though the meetings do not materialize).Members of the Trump transition team conduct secretive, back channel meetings with Putin operatives.Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin speak alone in Helsinki, then Mr. Trump accepts Mr. Putin's claim that he didn't meddle in the 2016 election and repudiates the intelligence community's assessments to the contrary.Those incidents raise the that Mr. Trump has wittingly sought to advance Russian interests, but the evidence is merely circumstantial and consequently suggests low to moderate confidence in that assessment. In many but not all respects, witting assets can be more dangerous because they have deliberately entered into some sort of understanding or agreement to work on behalf of the foreign power's interests. But unwitting assets pose their own dangers. They have significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited with minimal actual coordination. In other words, they look and act more like puppets.In the following examples, Mr. Trump appears a potentially unwitting but responsive asset for Moscow, a finding in which there seems greater confidence:Mr. Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn reassures Russia that United States sanctions for election interference will be reversed, then lies about his conversation to the F.B.I. Mr. Trump publicly applauds Mr. Putin's lack of retaliation for the sanctions.Mr. Trump pursues a potentially lucrative Trump Tower Moscow project through the end of the campaign and at least implicitly encourages his lawyer to lie to Congress about the timing of the deal.The stark realityis that one might have a moderate to high confidence that decisions are being made by an American president who, in the process of getting elected and after assuming office, has acted with the interests of an often-hostile foreign power influencing him.And that conclusion is deeply worrisome as a national security matter.A failure by political leaders to condemn the activities of a Trump campaign that openly welcomed Russian hacking and privately encouraged timely releases of damaging information about the campaign's opponent would put our nation at further risk.As president, Mr. Trump has taken a series of steps at home and abroad that advance Russian policy interests. At home, he has weakened American democracy, all but paralyzed our ability to act through legislation and vilified key institutions -- particularly law enforcement and the intelligence community. Abroad, Mr. Trump has weakened NATO, given Russia an increasingly free hand in Syria, minimized sanctions against Russian actors, questioned America's commitment to protecting Eastern Europe from Russian aggression and defended Mr. Putin on the world stage.It's hard to look toward the 2020 election with anything but concern -- we have not come far enough to protect the democratic process from the threat of foreign election interference, and one reason may well be that the man in the Oval Office has been compromised and continues to be influenced, wittingly or otherwise, by a Kremlin eager to see the United States remain vulnerable.Joshua A.

By seamlessly conflating the terms \"collusion\" and \"conspiracy,\" and absolving President Trump of both, Mr. Barr revealed that the Russian information warfare technique of \"reflexive control\" has officially entered American public discourse -- and threatens, with his recent allegations of campaign \"spying,\" to stay there for a while.Reflexive control is a technique of psychological manipulation through disinformation. The idea is to feed your adversary a set of assumptions that will produce a predictable response: That response, in turn, furthers a goal that advances your interests. By luring your opponent into agreeing with your initial assumptions, you can control the narrative, and ultimate outcome, in your favor. Best of all, the outcome is one in which your adversary has voluntarily acceded. This is exactly what has happened with much of the American public in the course of Mueller's investigation.The assumptions that culminated in Mr. Barr's conclusions began almost two years ago, when the White House, Trump supporters and the media characterized the focus of the special counsel's investigation as \"collusion.\" The word \"collusion\" does not appear anywhere in Mr. : His mandate was to investigate any \"links and/or coordination\" between the Trump campaign and Russia. There is a good reason for this: \"Collusion\" is the legal equivalent of Jell-O. Outside of specific factual contexts -- such as price fixing in antitrust law -- the word \"collusion\" has no legal meaning or significance. In fact, in his report, Mr. Mueller explicitly stated that his conclusions were not about collusion, \"which is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States code.\"The Trump administration seized on this legal ambiguity early on, with the refrain that \"collusion is not a crime.\" The standard set here is that anything falling below criminally chargeable behavior is acceptable. When it comes to the presidency, this is not true. The Constitution lays out the procedure for removing an unfit president from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"Nevertheless, we took the bait: Collusion may not be a crime, lawyers and pundits responded, but conspiracy is. This \"reflexive\" response adopted criminality as the bar to be met.But as we found in the report, conspiracy is very narrowly defined: It requires proof of an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and an \"overt act\" in furtherance of that agreement. Unlike collusion, moreover, conspiracy requires that a party have a specific state of mind -- knowledge -- of the criminal nature of his or her actions. As a former F.B.I. special agent who conducted counterintelligence investigations, I can attest that foreign intelligence services do not operate on the basis of explicit agreements or even actions that, standing alone, constitute criminal activity.Foreign intelligence services rely on manipulating vulnerabilities over time -- like greed, or fear of exposure of a secret -- to puppeteer those under their influence into acting in their interests without saying a word. Our adversaries also want to make sure they have plausible deniability, so it would be impossible to uncover an agreement made directly with a foreign government itself: As detailed in Mr. Mueller's report, most of Russia's overtures were made through cutouts and intermediaries, seeking to capitalize on the ambition of members of the Trump campaign to push along their efforts. Counterintelligence is, in effect, chasing ghosts, which is why the tools used to investigate foreign intelligence activity are secret, like human sources or electronic surveillance. It is not the stuff of which criminal prosecutions are made, and it is partly for this reason that operatives rarely see the inside of a courtroom.Nevertheless, we reached an informal agreement with the White House over the last two years: The test of Mr. Trump's fitness for office rested on Mr. Mueller's findings that the president committed a crime, namely, conspiracy with the Russian government to influence the election.Mr. Barr took advantage of this bargain, using \"collusion\" interchangeably with \"conspiracy.\" The Mueller report contains hundreds of pages detailing collusion -- behaviors that include encouraging, facilitating and being receptive to efforts by Russia and its partners, like WikiLeaks, to influence the election -- but the attorney general concluded that there was \"no underlying collusion with Russia.\" This was based on his conclusion that Mr. Mueller did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy. In short, \"collusion\" is now the same as \"conspiracy,\" and without proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the latter, the former doesn't exist.We should take a lesson from this current moment, because it is not over. Mr. Barr's latest accusations of the F.B.I. \"spying\" on the Trump campaign once again threatens to flip our understanding of words upside down. By obscuring the important role of checks and balances -- including the role of the judiciary in approving legal electronic surveillance based on probable cause -- Mr. Barr seeks to make the actions of the investigators, rather than the compromising behavior of the members of the Trump campaign they were investigating, the focus of debate. Undermining the integrity of law enforcement is a double boon for Russia, which seeks to erode Americans' confidence in our institutions and constrain our ability to stop their efforts. This time, however, we can stop our reflexive actions to Mr. Barr's linguistic sleight of hand and keep the focus on the national security threat posed by Mr. Trump's relationship with Russia. If we don't, Mr. Putin has certainly won.Asha Rangappa (@AshaRangappa), a senior lecturer at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale, was an F.B.I. special agent focusing on counterintelligence investigations.

It was a broadcast of an hourlong \"Firing Line\" interview in 1980 between William F. Buckley Jr. and Malcolm Muggeridge, the British journalist who late in life converted to Christianity.In the course of the interview, Mr. Muggeridge used a parable. Imagine that the Apostle Paul, after his Damascus Road conversion, starts off on his journey, Mr. Muggeridge said, and consults with an eminent public relations man. \"I've got this campaign and I want to promote this gospel,\" Paul tells this individual, who responds, \"Well, you've got to have some sort of symbol.\" To which Paul would reply: \"Well, I have got one. I've got this cross.\"\"The public relations man would have laughed his head off,\" Mr. Muggeridge said, with the P.R. man insisting: \"You can't popularize a thing like that. It's absolutely mad.\"The reaction of Mr. Muggeridge's imaginary P.R. person is understandable. The Episcopal priest Fleming Rutledge has written that until the accounts of Jesus' death burst upon the Mediterranean world, \"no one in the history of human imagination had conceived of such a thing as the worship of a crucified man.\" And yet the crucifixion -- an emblem of agony and one of the cruelest methods of execution ever practiced -- became a historical pivot point and eventually the most compelling symbol of the most popular faith on earth.As a non-Christian friend of mine put it to me recently, the idea that people would worship a God who is compassionate toward us is one thing, but to worship a God who suffers and dies -- as a condemned criminal, no less -- is distinct to Christianity. In my friend's understated words, \"When you think about it, it is a little strange.\"Perhaps the aspect of the crucifixion that is easiest to understand is that according to Christian theology, atonement is the means through which human beings -- broken, fallen, sinful -- are reconciled to God. The ideal needed to be sacrificed for the non-ideal, the worthy for the unworthy.But the cross is more than simply a gateway to the City of God. \"I could never myself believe in God, if it were not for the cross,\" John Stott, one of the most important Christian evangelists of the last century, wrote in \"The Cross of Christ.\" \"The only God I believe in is the One Nietzsche ridiculed as 'God on the cross.' In the real world of pain, how could one worship a God who was immune to it?\" From the perspective of Christianity, one can question why God allows suffering, but one cannot say God doesn't understand it. He is not remote, indifferent, untouched or unscarred.Scott Dudley, the senior pastor at Bellevue Presbyterian Church in Bellevue, Wash., and a lifelong friend, pointed out to me that on the cross God was reconciling the world to himself -- but God was also, perhaps, reconciling himself to the world. The cross is not only God's way of saying we are not alone in our suffering, but also that God has entered into our suffering through his own suffering.Scott readily concedes that there's no good answer to the question, \"Why is there suffering?\" Jesus never answers that question, and even if we had the theological answer, it would not ease our burdens in any significant way. What God offers instead is the promise that he is with us in our suffering; that he can bring good out of it (life out of death, forgiveness out of sin); and that one day he will put a stop to it and redeem it. God, Revelation tells us, will make \"all things new.\" For now, though, we are part of a drama unfolding in a broken world, one in which God chose to become a protagonist.One other significant consequence the crucifixion had was to \"introduce a new plot to history: The victim became a hero by offering himself as a willing victim,\" in the words of the Christian author Philip Yancey. Citing the works of the French philosopher Rene Girard and Mr. Girard's student Gil Bailie, Mr. Yancey argues that a radiating effect of the cross was to undermine abusive power and injustice; that care for the disenfranchised and those living in the shadows of society came about as a direct result of Jesus' crucifixion.Edward Shillito, a minister in England who watched waves of badly wounded soldiers return from World War I, wrote a poem, \"Jesus of the Scars,\" in which he said, \"The heavens frighten us; they are too calm; In all the universe we have no place. Our wounds are hurting us; where is the balm? Lord Jesus, by thy scars we know thy grace.\" Mr. Shillito ended his poem with this stanza, which beautifully captures what makes the cross unique:The other gods were strong; but thou wast weak;They rode, but thou didst stumble to a throne;But to our wounds only God's wounds can speak,And not a god has wounds, but thou alone.Worshiping a God of wounds is a little strange, as my friend said. For some, it is grotesque and contemptible, a bizarre myth, an offense. But for others of us, what happened to Jesus on the cross is profoundly moving and life-altering -- not just a historical inflection point, but something that won and keeps winning our hearts. As individuals with wounds, flawed and fallen, we cannot help but return to the foot of the cross.The most important moment in my faith pilgrimage was when the cross became my interpretive prism. What I mean by this is that I was and remain a person with a skeptical mind and countless questions. There are parts of the Bible I still find puzzling, difficult and troubling. (That is true of many more Christians than you might imagine, and of many more Christians than are willing to admit.)But I did arrive at a settled belief that whatever the answer to those questions were -- answers I'm unlikely to ever discover -- I would understand them in the context of the cross, where God showed his enduring love for people in every circumstance and in every season of life. I came to treasure a line from an 18th-century hymn by Isaac Watts that I have replayed in my mind more often than I can count: \"Did e're such love and sorrow meet, Or thorns compose so rich a crown?\"In response to his fictional P.R. person's claim that using the cross as a symbol for faith would be mad, Malcolm Muggeridge replied: \"But it wasn't mad. It worked for centuries and centuries, bringing out all the creativity in people, all the love and disinterestedness in people, this symbol of suffering. And I think that's the heart of the thing.\"It is the heart of the thing. Where some see the cross as superstitious foolery or a stumbling block, others see grace and sublime love.

Wish fulfillment is all it was, though. It's a national disgrace that Trump sleeps in the White House instead of a federal prison cell, but it has been a while since I had any expectation that the special counsel Robert Mueller's findings, many of which were finally released to the public on Thursday, could set things right. Instead, I'd desperately hoped for something more modest: clarity. A rough public consensus on what happened in the 2016 election and its aftermath, akin to the Warren Commission report on the assassination of President John Kennedy, or the 9/11 Commission Report. A set of facts that serious people could agree on, leaving conspiracy theories at least somewhat marginalized.There are a lot of reasons Trump's election remains a festering wound. It was a horrifying shock to many of us and, given his decisive loss in the popular vote, an insult to democracy. But there was also so much destabilizing weirdness surrounding it. Trump's relationship with President Vladimir Putin of Russia has long been suspect; as Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who was the House majority leader at the time, told colleagues in a , \"There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.\" (He was speaking of Dana Rohrabacher, the slavishly pro-Putin former Republican congressman.)Several weeks before Trump was inaugurated, America's intelligence agencies reported that Russia had engaged in cyberoperations to help him win. In the months that followed, there was one staggering revelation after another about secret conversations between Trump's circle and various figures linked to Russian intelligence.At the same time, the new administration unleashed on the public a degrading cacophony of lies, of the sort many of us associate with authoritarian countries like Russia. The day after the new president was sworn in, Sean Spicer, Trump's first press secretary, stood in the White House briefing room and insisted that the inauguration crowd had been unprecedented in size. This was terrifying, despite the petty stupidity of the untruth, because Americans were not yet used to being told to believe government diktats over the clear evidence of their senses.This quickly became our new normal. Once Republicans realized the power they could amass by collaborating in Trumpian mendacity, most of them gleefully abandoned any sense of epistemological solidarity with their fellow Americans. There's a reason \"\" has become one of the most overused terms of the Trump era. And perhaps the biggest lie of all was that Mueller's investigation, rather than the events that precipitated it, was the real scandal, an attempt to frame Trump rather than an effort to get to the bottom of an assault on our democracy.It was probably naive to think that Mueller could cut through such a thick web of falsity. But if anyone could have, it would have been him, the embodiment of a set of old-fashioned virtues that still ostensibly command bipartisan respect. Over the months of the investigation, he came to represent for many an ideal of manliness that rebuked Trump's insecure machismo. He was a war hero, Trump was a shirker. He was a public servant, Trump a venal con man. He was honest, Trump a liar. America doesn't have a Walter Cronkite anymore, a person whose word is trusted implicitly across the political spectrum. Mueller was as close as we were going to get.He and his team have now given us the clearest picture yet of the murky events surrounding Trump's ascension. \"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion,\" . The Trump campaign welcomed this interference, but, we now know, did not assist in it. \"Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" Once in office, Trump sought to thwart the investigation into what Russia had done. He believed -- correctly, as it happens -- that Russia's actions cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory. The report says he may also have feared that what appears to be his advance notice of the WikiLeaks dumps of hacked Democratic emails and his campaign's now infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian emissaries offering dirt on Hillary Clinton \"could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.\" Further, although \"the President publicly stated during and after the election that he had no connection to Russia,\" his company was negotiating to build a Trump Tower Moscow throughout most of the campaign, a fact that could have hurt him politically if it got out.Numerous commentators have said that the report reads like a road map, and in a remotely functional country that's what it would be. Mueller makes it clear that because of the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, \"we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.\" Instead, the evidence is laid out for congressional action, or even for prosecutors to indict after Trump leaves office.The test for us now is how much evidence still matters. Before the report came out, William Barr, Trump's attorney general, created a fog of disinformation around it, blatantly misleading the public about what it contained.Weeks before anyone else could read the report, he tried to close the door on obstruction, implying falsely that Mueller meant to leave the decision to him. In a news conference on Thursday, Barr repeatedly said that Mueller had found no \"collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller, however, never examined the case through the lens of \"collusion,\" which isn't a term in criminal law: \"In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of 'collusion,'\" the report says. Barr claimed that \"evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.\" The report is overstuffed with evidence of corrupt motives.But most people aren't going to read the nearly 500-page report. Republicans have already seized on Barr's words -- and on the lack of criminal charges in a document that was never going to contain criminal charges -- to claim total vindication for Trump. The president's manifest disloyalty to the country in trying to halt an investigation into a foreign attack on an American election is, to the right, of no account. Nor are the counterintelligence implications of Mueller's findings, which aren't part of the report. In the eyes of the president's supporters, his campaign did not participate in the criminal conspiracy that helped elect him, so no more needs to be said.The reaction to the report shows that between the minority of Americans who support Trump and the majority who do not, there may no longer be even the possibility of a shared sense of reality or national purpose. Even as exemplary a figure as Mueller cannot change that.Compounding the problem, Republicans are willing to act unilaterally on their perception of reality, but Democrats are not. As Hannah Arendt wrote in 1951, \"Totalitarianism will not be satisfied to assert, in the face of contrary facts, that unemployment does not exist; it will abolish unemployment benefits as part of its propaganda.\" The same logic underlies Republican threats to actualize fantasies about an attempted deep-state coup by opening an investigation into the Mueller investigation's origins.Most Democrats, conversely, have facts on their side, but not conviction. They are reluctant to begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump because majorities, in polls, don't support it, and there is no Republican buy-in. Whether or not this is politically wise, failing to impeach would be a grave abdication. If you want people to believe that the misdeeds enumerated in the Mueller report are serious, you have to act like it. To not even try to impeach Trump is to collaborate in the Trumpian fiction that he has done nothing impeachable. On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren took the lead among Democratic presidential candidates in to begin. Others should follow her. Mueller has given us the truth of what Trump has done, and in that sense the hokey faith the Resistance put in him was not misplaced. But right now only a political fight can make that truth matter."},

But one conclusion is categorical: \"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.\"That may sound like old news. The Justice Department's and three companies in February 2018 laid bare much of the sophisticated Russian campaign to blacken the American democratic process and support the Trump campaign, including the theft of American identities and creation of phony political organizations to fan division on immigration, religion or race. The and a host of other dirty tricks have likewise been exhaustively chronicled.But Russia's interference in the campaign was the core issue that Mr. Mueller was appointed to investigate, and if he stopped short of accusing the Trump campaign of overtly cooperating with the Russians -- the report mercifully rejects speaking of \"collusion,\" a term that has no meaning in American law -- he was unequivocal on Russia's culpability: \"First, the Office determined that Russia's two principal interference operations in the 2016 U.S. presidential election -- the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations -- violated U.S. criminal law.\", which describes these crimes, is worthy of a close read. Despite a thick patchwork of redactions, it details serious and dangerous actions against the United States that Mr. Trump, for all his endless tweeting and grousing about the special counsel's investigation, has never overtly confronted, acknowledged, condemned or comprehended. Culpable or not, he must be made to understand that a foreign power that interferes in American elections is, in fact, trying to distort American foreign policy and national security.The earliest interference described in the report was a social media campaign intended to fan social rifts in the United States, carried out by an outfit funded by an oligarch known as \"Putin's chef\" for the feasts he catered. Called the , the unit actually sent agents to the United States to gather information at one point. What the unit called \"information warfare\" evolved by 2016 into an operation targeted at favoring Mr. Trump and disparaging Mrs. Clinton. This included posing as American people or grass-roots organizations such as the Tea Party, anti-immigration groups, Black Lives Matter and others to buy political ads or organize political rallies.At the same time, the report said, the of the Russian army's intelligence service opened another front, hacking the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and releasing reams of damaging materials through the front groups DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, and later through WikiLeaks. The releases were carefully timed for impact -- emails stolen from the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, for example, were released less than an hour after the damaging to Mr. Trump came out.All this activity, the report said, was accompanied by the well documented efforts to contact the Trump campaign through business connections, offers of assistance to the campaign, invitations for Mr. Trump to meet Mr. Putin and plans for improved American-Russian relations. Both sides saw potential gains, the report said -- Russia in a Trump presidency, the campaign from the stolen information. The Times documented between Mr. Trump and his associates and Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries. But the Mueller investigation \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"That is the part Mr. Trump sees as vindication, though the activities of his chaotic campaign team that the report describes are -- at best -- naive. It is obviously difficult for this president to acknowledge that he was aided in his election by Russia, and there is no way to gauge with any certainty .But the real danger that the Mueller report reveals is not of a president who knowingly or unknowingly let a hostile power do dirty tricks on his behalf, but of a president who refuses to see that he has been used to Since the publication of the report, Vladimir Putin and his government have been crowing that they, too, are now joining the White House in creating the illusion that the investigation was all about \"collusion\" rather than a condemnation of criminal Russian actions. was to restore relations between the United States and Russia, and to ease sanctions, the Russians certainly failed, especially given the added sanctions ordered by Congress over Moscow's interference.But if the main intent was to intensify the rifts in American society, Russia backed a winner in Mr. Trump.A perceived victory for Russian interference poses a serious danger to the United States. Already, several American agencies are working, in partnership with the tech industry, to prevent election interference going forward. But the Kremlin is not the only hostile government mucking around in America's cyberspace -- and are two others honing their cyber-arsenals, and they, too, could be tempted to manipulate partisan strife for their ends.That is something neither Republicans nor Democrats should allow. The two parties may not agree on Mr. Trump's culpability, but they have already found a measure of common ground with the sanctions they have imposed on Russia over its interference in the campaign. Now they could justify the considerable time and expense of the special counsel investigation, and at the same time demonstrate that the fissure in American politics is not terminal, by jointly making clear to Russia and other hostile forces that the democratic process, in the United States and its allies, is strictly off limits to foreign clandestine manipulation, and that anyone who tries will pay a heavy price."},

He went on to denounce the \"Report\" -- scare quotes in the original -- for containing statements that \"are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad).\"So the Mueller report is now, in the official White House version, \"total exoneration,\" except when it's \"total bullshit.\" Got that?In June 2017, The Wall Street Journal editorial board, long a skeptic of Mueller's probe, offered the central argument for why an investigation was necessary. \"Russian meddling in U.S. elections is a serious matter and Americans need to know what happened,\" . \"If Mr. Trump or key associates canoodled with the Russians to steal an election, then he must face the likely consequence of impeachment.\"That's exactly right. And it's why an investigation by a partisan-controlled House or Senate committee would never have sufficed, either for the purposes of establishing the facts or affording the president the vindication he now claims. Would, say, the \"Nunes Report\" have convinced anyone who wasn't already planning to vote for Trump that no collusion had taken place? Would a decision by the president to fire Mueller in 2017 -- as he very nearly did -- have allayed suspicions, much less put the matter behind us?Only Mueller, with his reputation for probity and credibility among Democrats, could have prevented the collusion narrative from achieving the status of unshakable faith among millions of Americans, akin to the false \"Bush lied, people died\" narrative that still dogs the 43rd president. That required the no-stone-left-unturned approach manifest in the long investigation and 448-page report. Anything else would have been dismissed as a whitewash.So why aren't conservatives grateful?From the beginning of the investigation, conservatives have been invested in a counter-narrative that is as flawed as the collusion narrative itself. This has various elements, from to cast doubt on Russian interference, to the investigation had its genesis in Christopher Steele's salacious dossier, to the that there can be no obstruction of justice without an underlying crime -- a point that ought to be obvious to anyone who supported impeaching Bill Clinton for lying under oath about a non-criminal act.Most absurd: The claim, repeated Thursday by Attorney General William Barr, that the White House fully cooperated with the investigation. For more on that, of the report where then-White House counsel Don McGahn opted to quit instead of participating in the firing of Mueller.\"He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told [Reince] Priebus that the President had asked him to 'do crazy shit,' and informed Priebus and [Steve] Bannon that he was leaving.\"Here's what conservatives have largely failed to acknowledge: Trump's absolution by Mueller didn't come about because his intentions were innocent, but because his aims were thwarted or his methods were incompetent.If his own staff hadn't blocked him from firing Mueller, he would have done so. If Don Jr. had been delivered a crate full of stolen Clinton documents at that Trump Tower meeting with a shady Russian lawyer, he would have taken it. If this newspaper hadn't exposed Paul Manafort for taking illicit cash from Ukraine's president, he might well have wound up as a senior U.S. official vulnerable to Russian blackmail. If the Senate hadn't blocked Trump from , or public opinion hadn't revolted over his performance at Helsinki, he would have cozied up to Vladimir Putin.Trump is the guy who keeps getting saved from walking into oncoming traffic, only to complain that someone yanked his collar. This makes Mueller the latest in a long list of figures whose scrupulousness saved Trump from the consequences of his unscrupulousness. For this,the special counsel will get no thanks from the president, much less an apology from all the two-bit talking heads who spent the past 23 months questioning his motives and impugning his integrity.The good news in all this is that the rule of law and reason still function in the Age of Trump -- despite Trump. Responsible officials checked a dangerous president. Political pressure allowed Mueller to finish his report and ensured its release. Americans got a comprehensive presentation and analysis of the facts, which may have exonerated the president legally but which clearly indict him morally. Ultimately the matter will be settled at the polls in November 2020.The system, as they say, worked. Conservatives who claim to believe in that system should be grateful they didn't get their wish when they sought to tear it down."}

Michelle Goldberg makes the case for shunning administration officials who carried out the president's cruel policies at the southern border. Ross Douthat thinks liberals need to reckon more fully with Barack Obama's mixed legacy on immigration. And David Leonhardt worries that the Democratic Party lacks a clear and convincing agenda on legal and illegal immigration.Then, which of the lesser-known Democratic candidates are mounting the most credible campaigns for the highest office in the land? The columnists discuss Mayor Pete Buttigieg's fresh face, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's \"resistance\" candidacy, Andrew Yang's guaranteed-income proposal, Senator Cory Booker's mass appeal and Senator Amy Klobuchar's \"Minnesota nice.\"Ross on and Michelle on , and .David on , and David Frum, \"\" (The Atlantic)I've been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I'm a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I'm against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \"reasonable\" elites. I've written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I'm working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I've been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \"liberal\" as an epithet, but that's basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump's presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I've written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian emigre who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I've worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago -- first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I've since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I'm also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today's Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges -- inequality, climate change, the rise of China -- and they'll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.This week's show is produced by Alex Laughlin for Transmitter Media and edited by Lacy Roberts.

{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/us/politics/mueller-report-democrats-republicans.html", "title": "Reaction to Mueller Report Divides Along Partisan Lines", "authors": "Peter Baker, Nicholas Fandos", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- House Democrats vowed on Friday to pursue the revelations in on President Trump but drew little Republican support in a nation still deeply polarized over the investigation that has dogged the White House for two years.The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena demanding that the Justice Department hand over an unredacted copy of Robert S. Mueller III's report along with underlying evidence by May 1 and promised \"major hearings\" into its findings. And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts became the most prominent Democrat to call for impeachment.But most Republican lawmakers remained silent on the report, meaning any effort to force Mr. Trump from office faced long odds barring an unexpected change of political circumstances. The months to come may see more fireworks over the report, including a constitutional clash in court over releasing it in full, but privately some Democrats have concluded that the president's fate will probably be decided at the ballot box next year.While Mr. Trump had initially greeted the report as an exoneration, he spent at least part of the day in Florida stewing about disloyal aides who talked with investigators and sounded more defensive than celebratory. He expressed particular unhappiness over the report's inclusion of granular accounts of his efforts to derail the investigation based on F.B.I. interviews and notes of his own advisers.\"Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by 18 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated & totally untrue,\" . \"Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed.\"\"Because I never agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad),\" . \"This was an Illegally Started Hoax that never should have happened, a...\"At that point he stopped and did not finish the thought until : \"...big, fat waste of time, energy and money.\" He went on to vow to go after his pursuers, whom he called \"some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes, perhaps even Spying or Treason.\"The mention of notes appeared to refer to his former White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who told investigators that the president pressed him to have Mr. Mueller fired and complained when he took notes. Mr. Trump's lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, later on Friday. \"It can't be taken at face value,\" he said in an interview. \"It could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.\"But Mr. McGahn had no motive to lie, according to Mr. Mueller, and he rebutted Mr. Giuliani through his own lawyer. \"It's a mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to relitigate incidents the attorney general and deputy attorney general have concluded were not obstruction,\" said the lawyer, William A. Burck. \"But they are accurately described in the report.\"On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidates condemned the president's conduct and called for action against him.\"The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,\" , who is seeking the Democratic nomination. \"That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States.\"In an era of deep polarization, Mr. Mueller's 448-page report quickly became yet another case study in the disparate realities of American politics as each camp interpreted it through its own lens and sought to weaponize it against the other side.The president's defenders insisted he was cleared because even though Mr. Mueller confirmed a wide-ranging Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 election on Mr. Trump's behalf, the special counsel established no criminal conspiracy with his campaign and opted not to decide whether to accuse the president of obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump's critics called it a devastating indictment of a candidate willing to profit from the help of a foreign power and a president who repeatedly sought to disrupt or end the investigation even if he was not charged with violating the law.[]Few Republicans expressed concern about Mr. Mueller's findings, with most lawmakers out of town for the spring recess studiously avoiding comment. One of the exceptions was Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who said he was \"appalled\" that the president's campaign welcomed help from Russia.\"I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the president,\" . \"Reading the report,\" he added, \"is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders.\"Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said the report \"documents a number of actions taken by the president or his associates that were inappropriate,\" but pointed to the conclusion by Attorney General William P. Barr and his deputy, Rod J.

As written, he said, Mr. Nadler's subpoena was demanding \"millions of records that would be plainly against the law to share\" because of investigators' extensive use of a grand jury.\"The attorney general offered up a 400-page report that he wasn't bound to provide,\" Mr. Collins said. \"The attorney general stands ready to testify before our committee and to have the special counsel do the same. Yet Chairman Nadler disregards all of this good-faith transparency without even taking the department up on its offer to review material under the redactions.\"Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has publicly opposed impeachment unless Democrats can attract bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, where 20 Republicans would be needed to achieve the two-thirds vote required for conviction.Ms. Pelosi has scheduled a conference call for all House Democrats on Monday to discuss what she called \"a grave matter.\" Speaking to reporters in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where she was meeting with political leaders on Friday morning, Ms. Pelosi said she would not, as a matter of principle, criticize the president while out of the country.But she signaled that Congress would not sit by. \"We believe that Article I, the legislative branch, has the responsibility of oversight of our democracy, and we will exercise that,\" she said.She faces a restive liberal base that is pressing her to go further and open a formal impeachment inquiry.\"Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the closely watched New York freshman, . \"But,\" she added, \"the report squarely puts this on our doorstep.\"Other Democrats were more reluctant, arguing that the party was better off litigating the future on the campaign trail.\"We should certainly see the entire, unredacted report,\" said Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. \"But if we spend the next six months obsessed with this alone, instead of job training, health care and infrastructure, that would be a big mistake.\""},

Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, praised President Trump last spring for backing the rule of law and commended the Constitution and American culture for protecting lawfulness. \"I don't think there's any threat to the rule of law in America today,\" he said at a .Mr. Rosenstein left unmentioned that he and other senior leaders at the department and the F.B.I. were enduring Mr. Trump's sustained attacks on law enforcement in both public and private. The president had demanded Mr. Rosenstein falsely claim responsibility for dismissing the bureau's director and had toyed with firing the attorney general, prompting Mr. Rosenstein and the Justice Department's No. 3 official to vow to quit if the termination happened.The long-awaited report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, released on Thursday painted a portrait of law enforcement leaders more fiercely under siege than previously known. They struggled to navigate Mr. Trump's apparent disregard for their mission through a mix of threats to resign, quiet defiance and capitulation to some presidential demands. While their willingness to stay quiet might have protected their institutions, it also helped empower Mr. Trump to continue his attacks.Mr. Trump made good on some threats, the day after the midterm elections in November. The third-ranking Justice Department official, Rachel Brand, left three months before Mr. Rosenstein's speech to become Walmart's top lawyer. Mr. Rosenstein, who had an inside look at the investigation as its overseer and at Mr. Trump's behavior as a top political appointee, .\"The bad news is that the attacks were relentless, but the good news is that the department has a thin political layer and a strong tradition of professionalism,\" said Chuck Rosenberg, a former chief of staff to the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump, James B. Comey. \"But to see it and to read about the president's behavior is deeply disturbing.\"The president sought to undermine the Justice Department's leaders and thwart the Russia investigation from his first days in office.He demanded that Mr. Comey publicly say that he was not under investigation, and he asked Dana J. Boente, who was briefly the acting attorney general before Mr. Sessions was confirmed in February 2017, to let him know whether the F.B.I. was investigating the White House, according to the special counsel's report.His attacks on law enforcement were most vividly embodied in his treatment of Mr. Sessions, who was himself investigated by the F.B.I. over whether he lied about contacts he had with Russian officials during the election, the report said.Mr. Sessions, a top 2016 Trump campaign supporter, recused himself early into his tenure from election-related investigations, drawing Mr. Trump's ire. After the , the president demanded Mr. Sessions's resignation, saying he wanted an attorney general who would harness the Justice Department's power to protect the presidency.Mr. Sessions submitted his resignation, touching off a scramble among White House aides to keep the president from accepting it. While he let Mr. Sessions keep his job, Mr. Trump pocketed his resignation letter and set off fears within the White House that he would wield it to get what he wanted from law enforcement officials.Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff, told Mr. Sessions that the president could use the letter as a kind of \"shock collar,\" according to the report, and he told Mr. Trump that he had \"D.O.J. by the throat.\" It took Mr. Priebus two weeks to get the president to hand over the letter.Seeking a loyal attorney general, Mr. Trump asked a White House aide about Ms. Brand, a George W. Bush administration veteran. Was she \"on the team,\" and could he gauge her appetite for overseeing the Mueller inquiry or even becoming the attorney general?But the aide never reached out to Ms. Brand \"because he was sensitive to the implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an effort to end the investigation or fire the special counsel,\" according to the report.When Mr. Trump pushed Mr. Priebus to secure Mr. Sessions's resignation, Mr. Priebus warned the president that both Mr. Rosenstein and Ms. Brand would also resign, a scenario certain to plunge the Justice Department into crisis.The president agreed to hold off on firing Mr. Sessions for a day, to prevent the Sunday morning television news shows from focusing on it, and eventually dropped his plan to oust him. Instead, he stepped up his public criticisms. The attacks became so pointed, harsh and relentless that Mr. Sessions prepared another resignation letter and carried it with him whenever he went to the White House, according to the report.\"Attorney General Sessions carrying a resignation letter with him each time he had a meeting at the White House is a vivid reflection of the dysfunctional and unprecedented approach this president has taken towards the Department of Justice and federal law enforcement,\" said Matthew S. Axelrod, a partner at Linklaters and a former Justice Department official and prosecutor under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama.Mr. Sessions resisted multiple entreaties to reverse his recusal so he could oversee and curtail the Mueller inquiry; by the time the criminal investigation of him ended in March 2018, he could do little to get back in the president's graces.Mr. Rosenstein, whose office received briefings every other week on the progress of the investigation, would have glimpsed the gravity of the situation as the special counsel interviewed witnesses.He was also in the unusual position of being a witness himself in the investigation that he oversaw. Critics have said that role should have prompted Mr. Rosenstein to recuse himself from the inquiry, but top ethics lawyers at the Justice Department cleared him to oversee the special counsel, a department spokeswoman said. She added that the special counsel's office never asked about or questioned that decision.After Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey as the director of the F.B.I., setting off a storm of criticism, he asked Mr. Rosenstein to give a news conference and say that the firing had been his idea.Mr. Rosenstein warned the president that the news conference was a bad idea \",\" Mr. Mueller's investigators wrote. Mr. Sessions told White House lawyers that Mr. Rosenstein was upset about being used as a pretext for the ouster, and both officials told Donald F. McGahn II, then the White House counsel, that Mr. Trump was spinning a false narrative about Mr. Rosenstein's role in the termination.Mr. Rosenstein proved to be deeply rattled during the chaotic days after Mr. Comey's firing. He discussed the possibility of to remove Mr. Trump as president and suggested that he secretly record Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, according to people briefed on the events. Mr. Rosenstein has denied their accounts.When those revelations surfaced in news reports more than a year later, in September 2018, Mr. Rosenstein braced himself to be fired. But after meeting with Mr. Trump and his aides, Mr. Rosenstein and oversaw the Mueller investigation through the end.In February, he once again complimented Mr. Trump in about the rule of law.\"I'm very confident that when we look back in the long run on this era of the Department of Justice,\" he said, \"the president will deserve credit for the folks that he appointed to run the department.\"Attorney General William P. Barr, who took office that month, appears to be trying to reset the relationship between the White House and the Justice Department. He has helped further the president's agenda on and , and he has vowed to investigate whether the Russia investigation was tainted by what he called unlawful \".\"He also worked to offset the Mueller report's damning portrait of Mr. Trump. On Thursday, just before the report's release, Mr. Barr held a news conference in which he offered a striking defense of Mr. Trump, highlighting facts to help build a case for exoneration and avoiding assertions that were more damaging for the president.\"There was relentless speculation in the news media about the president's personal culpability,\" Mr. Barr told reporters. \"Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.\""},

Schmidt, Maggie Haberman", "contents": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump's lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, attacked the credibility of a former White House counsel on Friday, saying his account of how Mr. Trump told him to remove the special counsel was inaccurate.Mr. Giuliani's statement was the most extensive pushback by the president's lawyers against the former counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who cooperated extensively with the special counsel's investigators. The , released on Thursday, also included several damning examples of how Mr. Trump tried to interfere with the investigation, like Mr. McGahn's account.\"It can't be taken at face value,\" Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. \"It could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.\"Mr. McGahn's lawyer, William A. Burck, pushed back on Mr. Giuliani's attack.\"It's a mystery why Rudy Giuliani feels the need to relitigate incidents the attorney general and deputy attorney general have concluded were not obstruction,\" Mr. Burck said. \"But they are accurately described in the report.\"The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, examined a wide range of actions that Mr. Trump took as president that could be considered obstruction of justice. Investigators relied heavily on Mr. McGahn, who provided detailed accounts of what Mr. Trump did and said behind closed doors as he tried to maintain control over the Russia investigation.Among the damaging episodes was one based largely on Mr. McGahn that laid out how Mr. Trump told him in June 2017 to have Mr. Mueller ousted because he had several conflict of interest issues. Mr. McGahn believed the conflicts had little merit and told senior White House officials that he was going to resign instead of carrying out Mr. Trump's order.Mr. Giuliani said that the president never asked Mr. McGahn to have Mr. Mueller removed, adding that Mr. Trump was simply venting about his frustrations with the special counsel's investigation, which had cast a cloud over his presidency.\"If it were subject to cross-examination or analysis, it would be a different version,\" Mr. Giuliani said.On the day Mr. McGahn threatened to quit, Mr. Burck told him to hold back on telling other White House officials about what the president was asking him to do. Mr. Burck wanted to stop Mr. McGahn from roping other White House officials into the obstruction of justice investigation and from creating the impression that Mr. McGahn was willing to help Mr. Trump oust Mr. Mueller.Because Mr. McGahn mainly discussed the issue with Mr. Burck, there are not many witnesses to back him up. In an effort to substantiate Mr. McGahn's credibility, Mr. Mueller's team obtained Mr. McGahn's phone records from the episode. Although Mr. McGahn told investigators that there were two conversations he had with Mr. Trump, the records show only one call, according the report.\"While McGahn was not certain of the specific dates of the calls,\" the report said, \"McGahn was confident that he had at least two phone conversations with the president in which the president directed him to call the acting attorney general to have the special counsel removed.\"The report said that investigators accepted Mr. McGahn's account because he was \"a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.\"In attacking Mr. McGahn, Mr. Giuliani went further than the president had earlier Friday, when he walked up to the line of calling Mr. McGahn out on Twitter. that \"statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by 18 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated & totally untrue.\"\"Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed,\" the president tweeted."},

Among these women, 15 percent skipped their first prenatal checkup or put off their first prenatal visit -- some as late as their third trimester.It also suggested that maternal stress, exacerbated by commuting, might be a factor. The researchers said they hoped their work would lead to policy changes to expand maternity leave to include the prenatal period. For pregnant women with long commutes, time off can be \"particularly important,\" they wrote.______That's how many Americans believe men are better suited emotionally for politics than most women, according to a new report from Georgetown University.

Wouldn't something be lost, she asked, if the historically diverse slate of 2020 Democrats was passed over?\"Personally I'd love to see a woman,\" Ms. Neal, also 27, said at the event on Thursday night. \"If people are being catty and holding gender or race against a candidate, it would break my heart.\"As former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the 2020 race this coming week, Democrats have seen the strong diversity in their field -- with candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris reflecting the and largely base of the party -- become somewhat overshadowed by white male candidates. Bernie Sanders has , he and Mr. Biden lead in , and Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg have enjoyed outsize from in early primary states, extensive media coverage and viral success with online donors.Interviews with several dozen Democratic voters around the country show how the party, which enjoyed victories in 2018 that were powered by female and nonwhite candidates, is now grappling with two complicated questions about race, gender and politics in the Trump era.Is a white male the best face for an increasingly diverse Democratic Party in 2020? And what's the bigger gamble: to nominate a white man and risk disappointing some of the party's base, or nominate a minority candidate or a woman who might struggle to carry predominantly white swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that both Barack Obama and Mr. Trump won?Pam Van Arsdale, 64, of Bedford, N.H., said she would like to see a minority or female candidate catch fire, and worries that nominating a white man could cause some liberals to skip voting in November 2020.\"I consider myself a centrist, middle-of-the-road Democrat. And the progressive side worries me. What are they going to do? Are they going to sit it out if they don't like the top candidate?\" she said while attending a recent event for .But Lee Kujawa, 72, of Wauwatosa, Wis., near Milwaukee, made a case for Mr. Biden, seeing him as \"the most electable.\"\"He can stand up to Trump,\" said Mr. Kujawa, who said he believed the party would not pay a penalty by nominating its first white male nominee since John Kerry in 2004. Referring to Mr. Biden, he said, \"He could pick Kamala Harris as a running mate; she's one of my top three favorites.\"[]White men have largely ruled both the Democratic and Republican parties throughout American history, even as they have declined to roughly 30 percent of the population, and many voters still have preconceptions of presidents as white and male. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are starting off with other advantages as well: They are the best-known candidates at this stage, both with experience running for president, and they are well positioned to have the money and resources to compete through the 2020 primaries.But as older white men, they are out of step with ascendant forces in the party today.Women, minorities and young people are fueling much of its energy, and they are well represented by multiple well-qualified, politically savvy female and nonwhite Democrats who are running. Ms. Harris in particular has had , and only Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders consistently outpace her in polls.The party also has a new primary calendar for 2020 that could help these candidates: The diverse Democratic electorates in California and Texas will vote earlier than usual, and candidates like Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker could also benefit from in the early primary state of South Carolina.Many of the voters interviewed said that the most important qualification was the ability to defeat Mr. Trump, who has come away from the recent release of the Mueller report more angry than elated and wants a political victory untainted by questions of legitimacy. To some, the best Democratic candidate will be one who can wrest voters who backed Mr. Trump in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as Democrats did somewhat successfully in 2018 to flip the House.Jason Pinkowski, 35, who lives in the Milwaukee suburbs, crossed off several Democrats -- Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders because they are too old, and Mr. O'Rourke because he is too young -- to arrive at Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris as his current favorites.\"Long story short, if a Democrat decides to put time in the Midwest, I think he or she will have a good chance,\" he said.The presumption that Democrats will turn out in force to beat Mr. Trump, no matter who the nominee is, has hurt the party before. Hillary Clinton, her campaign strategy, the news media and the F.B.I. have all been blamed for her loss. For whatever reason, she lost votes in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 compared to Mr. Obama in 2012, including a notable falloff among black voters.Mr. Trump, in turn, energized the Republican base, which appears to remain loyal to him for the most part, and also won over some Midwest voters who once backed Mr. Obama.David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said the key to threading the electoral needle in 2020 was a diverse presidential ticket able to stop the hemorrhaging of white rural voters and to excite minority voters. He pointed to Senator Sherrod Brown's success in Ohio in appealing to both electorates in his 2018 re-election in a state that otherwise voted for Republicans in statewide campaigns.\"If between the ticket you have someone who's got that economic populist brand of a Sherrod Brown, but also the diversity that will energize Cuyahoga County so that you have a margin of 200,000-plus versus 150,000, I think you win Ohio and all the rest of those Midwest states,\" Mr. Pepper said. He was referring to the Democrat-rich county dominated by the predominantly black city of Cleveland. (To be sure, Mr. Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016.)[]Others see the focus on electability as too limited -- and even as an underhanded way to discount black and female candidates.For this group, which includes voters and several political observers who focus on race and gender, there is a particular annoyance around code words they feel unduly penalize candidates. Questions about which contender is \"electable\" and who can \"bring the country together\" distract from areas where female and minority candidates may lead the pack, including policy proposals and who best energizes typical nonvoters.Compounding these frustrations have been Ms. Warren's campaign fund-raising struggles and the early buzz around candidates like Mr. O'Rourke, who himself has acknowledged that he benefits from white male privilege.\"Bringing the country together won't happen right now, so just vote for the best progressive policy,\" said Kyrsten Matthews, 29, who attended Ms. Warren's Birmingham, Ala., rally. \"I know that's what I'm going to do.\"For some voters interviewed during Ms. Warren's , which included stops in heavily black communities in Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, there was interest in candidates such as Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Sanders or Mr. Biden because of factors unrelated to identity.In Selma, Ala., Roderick West, 62, said he was looking to support Mr. Biden because of his experience as vice president. Supporters of Mr. Sanders say his calls for wide-scale change in the country's economic order make him a transformational candidate, regardless of skin color. And some admirers of Mr. Buttigieg say that, as a gay man, he brings diversity to the field and would be a history-making nominee.In conversations across eastern Iowa, Democratic voters acknowledged a feeling of whiplash after a midterm campaign defined largely by the success of women and people of color. Many of those interviewed seemed almost resigned to having a white male nominee, reserving their angst for what they view as a greater priority than diversity atop the Democratic ticket: defeating Mr. Trump.\"It's important to appeal to Republicans. I don't know if a minority candidate can do that,\" Catherine Rohret, who will turn 18 in June, said moments after watching Mr. O'Rourke campaign in Waterloo, Iowa. \"It hurts me to say because I'm a black woman. I would love to see a woman candidate.\"Rachel Cox, 35, from Iowa City, seemed exultant despite frigid temperatures moments after meeting Mr. O'Rourke at a St. Patrick's Day 5K in North Liberty, Iowa. A former Texan who waited until after the 2018 midterms to switch her registration to Iowa -- so she could vote for Mr. O'Rourke -- Ms. Cox said that a white male candidate might be better positioned to build a winning coalition.\"There could be two sides to that story,\" she said when asked if nominating another white man could depress turnout in some corners of the party. \"Beto could bring a lot of moderate Republicans who are maybe a little bit averse to voting for women or voting for minorities.\"Ms. Cox had good reason to be concerned about the role of discrimination in voter choices. In several instances during Ms. Warren's Southern tour, men who attended an event with the Massachusetts senator dismissed supporting her candidacy using sexist terminology.\"Trump will run over a woman,\" Carl West, 64, said as he walked to see Ms. Warren at the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. \"He'll just run a woman into the ground.\"Diane Henning, 70, a retired bookkeeper outside of Milwaukee, disagreed sharply. She said it would be a mistake for Democrats to nominate a white man in 2020.\"There are so many good women out there who could do the job,\" she said. \"I think women are a lot more open-minded, we certainly have been all of these years.\"For Hannah Reid, 22, who is a graduating senior at the University of Tampa and heard Mr. Buttigieg at an event recently, her decision making on a Democratic candidate will go beyond identity.\"I am a woman of color, but that's not all that I am,\" said Ms. Reid, who is black. Referring to Mr. Buttigieg, she said: \"He's in the L.G.B.T. community, which is something we've never seen before. It's got to be about more than just who you are; it's got to be about what you think and what you say, what your ideas are.\""},

She counterattacked. revealed that Ms. Sanders had acknowledged that her repeated claim in 2017 that she had personally communicated with \"countless\" F.B.I. officials who told her they were happy with President Trump's decision to fire James B. Comey as the agency's director was a \"slip of the tongue\" and not founded on any facts.Asked on \"Good Morning America\" if the report had damaged her credibility, Ms. Sanders responded that she had made the statement in the heat of the moment, and that it was not \"a scripted talking point.\"But then she added, \"I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot like the Democrat Party that went out for two and a half years and repeated time and time again that there was definitely Russian collusion between the president and his campaign.\"It has been a hallmark of the Trump White House never to admit a mistake, never to apologize and never to cede a point. This case was no different. \"The White House staff will never be lectured on truth-telling from the media that pushed a flat-out lie about Donald Trump for two years,\" Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in an email.Ms. Sanders, who has often taken news media outlets to task for what they write and report and has accused them of spreading \"fake news\" about Mr. Trump, was just a footnote in Mr. Mueller's 448-page report. But because of her public role, the anecdote involving her false statement loomed large in the broader portrait by the special counsel of a White House .And it remains to be seen how the incident and Ms. Sanders's response will affect her credibility with reporters, with whom she has had fewer interactions than many of her predecessors since the White House quietly phased out the daily press briefing over the past nine months.More often, Ms. Sanders speaks for the president on friendly programs like \"Fox & Friends.\" She has also come to view her role as a person who defends her colleagues and the president, rather than someone who delivers a message to the press about the work that is underway at the White House.Some of Mr. Trump's aides and allies acknowledged on Friday that it was problematic for the president's chief spokeswoman to spend airtime defending her own credibility. But White House officials -- some of whom think Ms. Sanders is taking an unfair beating in the press -- do not expect Mr. Trump to be fazed by the controversy. Unlike previous administrations, in which officials feared blows to their credibility in public, Mr. Trump's press aides are generally performing for an audience of one -- the president.For months, Ms. Sanders, who declined to comment, has toyed with the idea of moving on from a position she has held for almost two years as part of a White House press and communications team that has often seemed dysfunctional.The job of communications director has remained vacant since Bill Shine, the fifth person to hold the position, . Along with Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, and Mercedes Schlapp, a top communications adviser, Ms. Sanders is now viewed internally as part of a three-headed messaging operation, and it is not clear who is really in charge, other than Mr. Trump.Ms. Sanders's predecessor, Sean Spicer, suffered his own reputational damage on Day 1 of the administration, when Mr. Trump ordered him to falsely tell reporters that the crowd at his inauguration was \"the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.\" Mr. Spicer has since said he regretted that comment and his belligerent appearance in the briefing room that day, which also enraged the president.But for now, Ms. Sanders is not willing to admit any misstep.In an interview with Fox News on Thursday night, she told Sean Hannity that \"I acknowledged that I had a slip of the tongue when I used the word 'countless,' but it's not untrue\" because her broader point was that \"a number of both current and former F.B.I. agents agreed with the president.\"In her interview with George Stephanopoulos on \"Good Morning America,\" he also grilled her about her false statement that Mr. Trump did not dictate the administration's statement on a meeting that his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took with a Russian operative at Trump Tower in June 2016. Mr. Mueller's report revealed that the president's lawyers acknowledged that he did, in fact, dictate the statement that was released.\"I'm not denying that he had involvement in what the statement said,\" Ms. Sanders said on Friday. \"That was the information I was given at the time.\"In previous administrations, when it was revealed that press secretaries had delivered false statements from the White House podium, there was more of a reaction and often some soul-searching.\"She is in a credibility bind that in most White Houses would be disqualifying, but probably not in this one,\" said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"No matter how honorable you were coming in, when you sign up as the spokesman for someone who habitually lies, you, by necessity, become a habitual liar.\"In 2003, Scott McClellan, President George W. Bush's press secretary, told reporters that two senior administration officials, Karl Rove and I. Lewis Libby Jr., were \"not involved\" in a leak about Valerie Plame, the C.I.A. operative.Later, in his memoir, Mr. McClellan delivered a mea culpa, admitting that he had been given false information to disseminate to the press. \"I had unknowingly passed along false information,\" Mr. McClellan wrote, adding that five of the highest-ranking White House officials, including the president, had misinformed him.Others have survived accusations that they lied. In 1983, Larry Speakes, a press aide to President Ronald Reagan, told reporters that the notion that the United States would invade Grenada was \"preposterous.\" The invasion took place the next day, and Mr. Speakes said he learned of it belatedly.Jay Carney, Mr. Obama's press secretary, took heat for helping to propagate the president's message on the Affordable Care Act that \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\" after it became clear that the administration was unable to deliver on the promise.But for veteran aides of the Trump White House, the furor over Ms. Sanders's remark has only added to a bunker mentality shared by aides who feel they are constantly defending themselves, and the president, from unfair attacks.And on the president's favorite show, Ms. Sanders had the last word. \"James Comey was a disgraced leaker who tried to politicize and undermine the very agency he was supposed to run,\" she told Mr. Hannity. \"Firing James Comey remains one of the best decisions that the president made.\""},

Mueller III, and in the end agreed to . Even then, with the help of his lawyers, the president found it difficult to summon details from his presidential campaign in 2016 that might shed light on what happened.More than 30 times, he that he had no memory of what they were asking about, employing several formulations to make the same point.\"I do not remember.\"\"I do not recall.\"\"I have no recollection.\"\"I have no independent recollection.\"\"I have no current recollection.\"He did not remember learning about a held in June 2016 by his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman with visiting Russians promising \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. He did not remember being told in advance of Russian hacking of Democratic emails before the stolen messages were posted online.He did not remember any particular conversations with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser, during the last months of the campaign, much less discussions with him about WikiLeaks. He did not remember discussing a possible trip to Russia to promote a proposed tower project in Moscow. He did not remember an invitation from Russia's deputy prime minister to attend an economic forum in St. Petersburg.A fuzzy memory is not exactly unusual for any president given how much they typically juggle, much less a 72-year-old president who is the oldest ever elected for the first time. But Mr. Mueller's prosecutors considered his memory lapses unsatisfying and pressed Mr. Trump's lawyer again for an in-person interview, to no avail.\"The written responses, we informed counsel, 'demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask follow-up questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client's recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection,'\" said.Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's private lawyers, defended his client's answers on Friday. \"The president responded to the questions,\" he said. \"They are answers, not speculations.\"Mr. Trump rarely lacks for certainty in his public statements on camera, but has shown more caution when under oath.He said, \"I don't remember\" in a lawsuit involving his now-defunct Trump University and related to the university suit three years later, not counting 10 more times in the two interviews that he said, \"I don't recall\" or \"Can't remember.\" (He eventually for $25 million.)Prosecutors said such selective memory tended to make them suspicious.\"It's always a red flag when a witness appears to selectively forget the events most likely to be damning,\" said Dwight C. Holton, who spent 14 years as a prosecutor, most recently as United States attorney in Oregon.\"And when you have a witness who repeatedly and publicly thumps his chest about how great his memory is, then all of a sudden he has sudden massive memory loss -- well, let's just say that's a target I'd like to cross-examine in front of a jury.\"Barbara L. McQuade, a former United States attorney in Michigan, said the president's answers \"demonstrate why written answers are a poor substitute for an in-person interview.\"During a face-to-face encounter, she said, prosecutors can refresh a witness's memory by providing additional details or showing him documents. They can also come to a judgment based on body language.\"I have not dealt with a witness who has claimed not to remember facts as many times as Trump did, but it is impossible to read a witness's mind to know whether he is telling the truth,\" she said. \"Trump's refusal to participate in an interview,\" she added, \"hampered Mueller's investigation and contradicts\" the assertion by Attorney General William P. Barr that the president had cooperated fully.But it may have saved him from a worse outcome. Mr. Mueller began asking Mr. Trump for an interview in December 2017 only to be put off for months. The president's lawyers opposed the idea, worried that Mr. Trump, who has a documented history of making untrue assertions publicly, would testify falsely and walk into what they deemed a perjury trap.Bowing to the demands of the president's lawyers, Mr. Mueller agreed to submit written questions, and only about contacts with Russia before Mr. Trump took office, not about potential obstruction of justice once he entered the White House. When , they were so \"incomplete or imprecise,\" the report said, that Mr. Mueller complained to the president's legal team about \"the insufficiency of those responses.\"The answers Mr. Trump provided sounded more like lawyer speak than the blunt-talking president's usual colorful language. They included phrases like \"named entities or individuals\" and \"tangible support\" and \"no meaningful relationship.\"It may be hard to imagine Mr. Trump saying or writing this: \"In the course of preparing to respond to your questions, I have become aware that the campaign documents already produced to you reflect the drafting, evolution and sources of information for the speech I expected to give 'probably' on the Monday following my June 7, 2016, comments.\"But if his memory were hazy in many cases, it was crystal clear in at least one instance. Asked about a specific date that June, Mr. Trump noted that he had prevailed in Republican nomination contests in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana and South Dakota that day. \"I remember winning those primaries,\" he wrote.After Mr. Mueller pressed again for an in-person interview in December, Mr. Trump's lawyers refused again. The special counsel opted not to seek a subpoena to force the president to talk, unlike Ken Starr, the independent counsel who in 1998 subpoenaed President Bill Clinton and withdrew the order only after the president's legal team .Mr. Mueller said he had chosen not to press the issue because he had already \"made significant progress\" and a court fight to enforce a subpoena against a sitting president, even if successful, could prolong the investigation. \"We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation,\" the report said, \"against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report.\"Critics of Mr. Trump have questioned that decision, saying the special counsel should have held out for a formal interview. As it happened, by sticking to carefully scripted written answers, the president avoided any charge that he had misled investigators.That is an outcome neither he nor Mr. Mueller is likely to forget."},

About a quarter of its 88 floors will have no homes because they are filled with structural and mechanical equipment.The building and nearby towers are able to push high into the sky because of a loophole in the city's labyrinthine zoning laws. Floors reserved for structural and mechanical equipment, no matter how much, do not count against a building's maximum size under the laws, so developers explicitly use them to make buildings far higher than would otherwise be permitted.The towers benefiting the most from the zoning quirk have all sprouted during the past half-decade: enormous glass and steel buildings with lavish condominiums that sell for millions of dollars. Many line the blocks around Central Park, some of the most expensive and coveted real estate in the city, and have become second homes for Chinese billionaires, European tycoons and out-of-state hedge fund investors.But the proliferation of these buildings is provoking a backlash amid a broader debate about affordable housing, megaprojects for the ultrarich and the city's identity. Now, officials are seeking to rein in developers by proposing rules that would apply unusually large mechanical spaces toward a building's height limit.The motivation to build tall is obvious: panoramic views for residents and hefty profits for developers. A 95th floor condominium at 432 Park Avenue sold in December for $30.7 million, or about $7,592 a square foot. That same month, a unit about halfway down the building sold for $4,216 a square foot.\"It's pretty outrageous, but it's also pretty clever,\" said George M. Janes, a planning consultant who has tracked and filed challenges against buildings in New York with vast unoccupied spaces. \"What is the primary purpose of these spaces? The primary purpose is to build very tall buildings.\"The effort by the city to curb building heights has ignited a showdown with the powerful real estate industry, which has criticized the proposed rules as overly restrictive and misguided.Harry B. Macklowe, who developed 432 Park Avenue, said he agrees with the effort to establish firm rules around mechanical spaces, but he rejected claims that his building was using them to rise higher. Every mechanical floor, he said, has equipment necessary for the building to function.\"It offends me,\" Mr. Macklowe said, \"because we created a very nice building that fits into the skyline perfectly.\"Many of these towers stay vacant most of the year, so their owners are not subject to local and state income taxes because they are not city residents. As a result, the state and city have already begun a separate crackdown on them.State lawmakers proposed a pied-a-terre tax, an annual recurring tax on second homes valued at more than $5 million, but it was derailed . Instead, a one-time fee on the sale of multimillion-dollar homes.New York City's complicated building regulations are meant to produce predictable developments. Height requirements are imposed in most of the city, though parts of Manhattan are exempt. Every block is also effectively assigned a maximum square footage, which can be spread across smaller buildings on a block or condensed in larger developments.Savvy, well-heeled and patient developers have worked that system to their benefit. A developer seeking to build a supertall tower might start with one lot on a block and then buy unused square footage from its neighbors.With advancements in engineering and construction, that developer can take the accumulated square footage and concentrate it in a skinny mega-tower. Floors of mechanical space, exempt from the square footage calculations, make the tower even taller.\"There is no question that they have become this lightning rod because they are not just luxury housing but uber-luxury housing,\" said Elizabeth Goldstein, president of the Municipal Art Society, a nonprofit group that seeks to preserve the city's architecture and urban design. She said they were unaffordable not only for the 99 percent but also for most of the 1 percent.The city's proposal aimed at supertall buildings -- which needs to be approved by the City Council -- would not eliminate enormous mechanical spaces but would penalize projects that have them.Oversized mechanical floors -- those greater than 30 feet tall, or about three times the size of a typical apartment's ceiling height -- would be counted toward the building's maximum size. The rules would largely apply to developments around Central Park and in parts of Lower Manhattan.Two other cities with skyscrapers, Chicago and Miami, have similar zoning codes but regulate mechanical floors differently.In Chicago, big empty spaces -- those greater than 5,000 square feet -- are not counted toward the tower's overall size, though officials said they knew of no complaints about developers exploiting the rule. In Miami, mechanical spaces are subtracted from the maximum size unless the area is an atrium or an open-air feature.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the proposed rules would \"stop luxury developers from gaming the system.\"\"Artificially tall mechanical spaces that serve no purpose but to boost views of top-floor apartments violate the spirit of our zoning regulations,\" Mr. de Blasio said in a statement.But the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's influential lobbying arm, said the rules were too restrictive and at odds with engineering trends, such as the future need for large spaces for batteries to support renewable energy.At a recent public hearing, engineers and architects said the proposal would drive up the cost of construction.Bart A. Sullivan, an engineer in New York who has worked on high rises around the world, said supertall skyscrapers need large unoccupied floors for complex mechanical and structural equipment, including elevator motors, heating, ventilation and air conditioning.Developers, he said, could work within the proposed restrictions but would have to spend more on structural features.\"Most anything is possible if you throw enough money at it, but these projects have to make sense from an economic point of view,\" Mr. Sullivan said. \"They are tying the hands of the design professionals.\"There are legitimate reasons for large areas in buildings for mechanical and structural features, he said. At 432 Park Avenue, clusters of unoccupied sections throughout the tower allow wind to flow through and stabilize the building.That tower's , said that without the large, open-air mechanical floors, 432 Park Avenue would noticeably sway and be unacceptable to residents.\"When they come home, they want to feel like they are at home and not like they are on a boat, airplane or motorcycle,\" he said.Mr. Marcus used a similar engineering technique at Central Park Tower, which at 1,550 feet tall will be among the most slender residential skyscrapers in the world. More than a fifth of its height will remain unoccupied.The developer of the building, Gary Barnett, said he believed the city's proposal was reasonable, but he said that critics had mischaracterized the mechanical spaces in Central Park Tower.\"There is one void and everything else is truly necessary mechanical space, amenity space and high-ceiling retail space for the first Nordstrom in New York City,\" Mr. Barnett said.Some supporters of the new legislation argue that the rules do not go far enough to curb supertall buildings. They would largely apply to neighborhoods around Central Park and would not touch other areas with high rises, including Midtown and Hudson Yards.City planners first noticed the trend of using mechanical spaces in new buildings several years ago.But a turning point emerged over the past year and a half when Rafael Vinoly Architects, which designed 432 Park Avenue, unveiled plans for another building, a futuristic, barbell-shaped 32-story residential tower on the Upper East Side. It would top out at 510 feet tall, thanks to a 150-foot-tall midsection devoid of residences.Neighborhood associations, along with Mr. Janes, the planning consultant, filed a complaint with the city's Department of Buildings, noting that \"the project includes a huge void, which is larger than necessary for any mechanical use.\"But without changes in building rules the tower would be likely to avoid legal challenges: The developers described the super large midsection as an open area with structural features."},

Instead, a guard at the cathedral first had to climb a steep set of stairs to the attic -- a trip Mr. Mouton said would take a \"fit\" person six minutes.Only after a blaze was discovered could the fire department be notified and deployed. That means even a flawless response had a built-in delay of about 20 minutes -- from the moment the alarm sounded until firefighters could arrive and climb to the attic with hundreds of pounds of hoses and equipment to begin battling a fire.Those delays turned out to be devastating.\"I was stunned by the speed with which the oak in Notre-Dame burned,\" Mr. Mouton said. \"Oak that old can't burn like a match. It's absolutely incomprehensible.\"But fire safety experts said that Mr. Mouton and his team underestimated the risk -- and that the fire response they designed was far too slow to fight a blaze in time.\"It doesn't make any sense,\" said Jonathan Barnett, a fire safety authority at Basic Expert in Australia. \"Twenty minutes is a huge delay before you get people involved. Once that heavy timber starts to burn, you can't put it out. So I have no idea why they built in this delay.\"Guards responding to a fire alarm at Notre-Dame had to climb a steep set of stairs and check for a fire before they could notify the fire department.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.AtticGuards climbed up this staircase after a second alarm.By Evan Grothjan, Karthik Patanjali and Elian PeltierFrancois Chatillon, a senior architect involved in numerous restorations of France's historic monuments, also stressed that the intense fire risk in the oak timbers underneath Notre-Dame's lead roof was well known.Once lit, he said, \"It is like throwing a match in a matchbox, it's impossible to put out.\"For him the surprise was not that Notre-Dame burned this week, but \"that it didn't burn before.\"Mr. Mouton and his team were not solely responsible for all the decisions made to secure a monument as precious as Notre-Dame. At a minimum, their plans required approval up the chain at the Culture Ministry.Charlotte Hubert, who presides at the same group of chief architects in charge of historical monuments that Mr. Mouton belongs to, underscored that security at such buildings was tightly regulated.\"The chief architect isn't handed the keys and left to do exactly as he wants,\" Ms. Hubert said.Still, fire experts said that two of the top officials on the project, Mr. Mouton and a former firefighter, Lt. Col. Regis Prunet, appeared to have miscalculated what was needed to protect such an unusual, complex and irreplaceable building from a fire.Scientists consulted by The New York Times said fire dynamics indicated that, while the dense timbers may take time to burn completely, a fire would naturally race across the original timbers at Notre-Dame. It was a mistake to assume otherwise, they said.Mr. Mouton was the architect in charge of Notre-Dame between 2000 and 2013, and in that position he oversaw a revamp of fire safety.\"The issue of fire safety was brought up as soon as I arrived,\" he said. \"I managed the issue from beginning to end.\"Mr. Prunet, the former firefighter, became fire safety adviser at the Culture Ministry and worked with Mr. Mouton and his team.The two men faced a monumental task. There was no proper fire protection plan in place, not even a plan to evacuate tourists or worshipers in case of a blaze, Mr. Prunet said in a separate interview. It was a miracle that nothing had happened before, he said, and \"a great irony\" that it should happen so soon after a plan was put in place.Both Mr. Mouton and Mr. Prunet said they had been given a free hand to design the most effective fire protection system. Money was not an issue.When the budget came in higher than expected, the authorities found the money and merely stretched the number of years to put the plan in place, to four from two, Mr. Mouton said.\"The project was not downsized because of financial considerations, I can absolutely guarantee that,\" he said.But even if no cost was spared, there was also a conservative approach to preserving the historic wooden structure in its unadulterated form. The designers were determined not to alter the attic with protective measures like sprinklers or fire walls.A willingness to sacrifice its pristine state for a compromise between what was possible 850 years ago and what is sensible today could have saved the spire, experts said.Firewall technology was used elsewhere in the cathedral -- but not in the attic. Mr. Prunet said the scale and complexity of the attic structure at Notre-Dame was of a different order.The cathedral was all but assured to go up in flames.\"In Notre-Dame it was very complicated because the oak beams were entangled with each other in what we call the forest,\" Mr. Prunet said.But the main reason to opt against fire walls, Mr. Mouton said, was because it risked \"mutilating\" the structure.\"It's true,\" he said, that the idea had been floated at the time, \"but it was discarded.\"\"It changes the appearance but also the elements, because to put up a partition you need to cut the wood. It's mutilating,\" Mr. Mouton said.Mr. Prunet added that sprinklers were not added because they would \"drown the whole structure.\"Instead, they said, the team had banked on prevention and detection. This was a conscious choice.Two guards were on site to monitor the delicate roof structure, day and night, like a bank vault. The cathedral was covered in smoke and heat sensors. Three times a day someone went up to check that the system was working.Mr. Mouton said he performed a trial of the time it took for a guard to investigate an alert, racing one of his guards to the top of the attic.''It does take a certain amount of time, including for someone who is very fit,\" he said. \"That solution seemed reasonable to me, considering that it's old oak and doesn't burn like that.\"Beyond that assumption, the alert system appears to have been flawed, too, beginning with the response to the first alarm at 6:20 p.m.The guard, seeing no obvious fire, gave the all-clear and came down.But when an alarm goes off, it is imperative to identify which alarm it was -- and why -- including whether a malfunction or an insect crawled into the apparatus, said Glenn Corbett, an associate professor of fire science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\"There wasn't an adequate investigation of that first alarm,\" Mr. Corbett said. \"That was probably the biggest mistake they made.\"At that point, presumably, a smoldering fire somewhere in the attic had begun to spread, though how the fire started has yet to be determined.Fire safety experts struggled to understand how Mr. Mouton came to believe that fire would spread slowly in old hardwood.Mr. Corbett said that in long-discredited lore, fires in heavy timber buildings dating to the 19th century were sometimes referred to as \"slow burning.\"Mr. Barnett, the Australian expert, underscored that the time it takes a fire to burn a piece of thick timber completely is entirely different from calculating how quickly a fire will spread.\"He miscalculated the large surface area,\" Mr. Barnett said. \"There's lots of energy and it's spreading very quickly.\"By the time the second alarm sounded at 6:43 p.m. and a guard climbed the stairs again, the fire was already a conflagration.The call finally went to the fire brigade at 6:51 p.m.\"We could have avoided all this with a modern detection system,\" said Guillaume Poitrinal, president of Fondation du Patrimoine, an organization that promotes French architectural heritage.The early detection technology was an aspirating smoke detection system provided by Siemens in 2013, but the company said it had not been given a service contract and could not speak to possible operational questions.Fire alarms in France never automatically alert the fire department, a spokesman for the Paris Fire Brigade confirmed.\"There can be false alarms, that's why the firefighters ask that someone go check,\" said Gabriel Plus, the spokesman. He called this \"removal of doubt.\"But outside experts suggested that in the case of Notre-Dame, the choices in the fire safety design did not leave enough time for that.There would have been one other solution: A permanent presence of firefighters on site. Buildings that run \"a significant risk\" in case of a fire, Mr. Plus said, sometimes get such a presence, among them the Louvre, the Paris court, the National Assembly and the National Library.Notre Dame, he said, was not in this category.Mr. Mouton acknowledged that firefighters on standby would have been the only reliable way to ensure against fire damage, but he said this would not have been justified when \"there are fires going off everywhere in Paris and in the suburbs.\"Some risk had to be accepted, he said. \"All things are relative.\"\"I am very troubled by what has happened,\" Mr. Mouton said.Would he design the system differently today, knowing what he knows now?\"The detection system would have been the same,\" he said, \"but the response system would have changed.\"\"Of course it's the first minutes that count,\" he said, pausing. Then he added: \"After the fact, one is always wrong and could have done better.\""},

Lawyers don't take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.\"Of all the hallucinogenic moments , this is one of the most dizzying. McGahn has been summoned to the White House in February 2018 because a livid Trump wants him to deny something truthful. McGahn explains that he can't \"correct\" an accurate report in The Times that the president had instructed him to \" He takes notes because he's a \"real lawyer.\"In fact McGahn, like many sucked into Trump's corrupting White House orbit, takes notes in the same way people try to get themselves inoculated when they enter a zone of contagion. He wants a contemporaneous record of the truth to protect himself and -- God knows -- the Republic against Trump's lies. He knows what an oath to uphold the Constitution means. If there is one overwhelming conclusion of the Mueller report it is that Trump, a.k.a. \"boss man,\" holds the law and truth in utter contempt. That this is unsurprising only makes it more appalling.\"I've had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn,\" Trump tells McGahn. \"He did not take notes.\" You don't take notes when you want no record of your dereliction. Of course, Cohn is Trump's role model: In New York, Cohn, McCarthyism's ruthless enforcer, was disbarred including dishonesty and fraud. The Mueller report won't move the political needle. Trump's tens of millions of supporters know all this. They knew he was a scam artist before they voted for him in 2016. One of the reasons the report is devastating is that its portrait of an iniquitous presidency once again begs a question of all Americans: How did we put this man in the Oval Office?It's a question for everyone. To deflect responsibility is too easy. The mirror Trump holds up is to America in its entirety, from Hudson Yards to the death of Main Street, from the Kardashians to the opioid crisis, from the financiers doing the rigging to those left out or left behind, from callow Republicans to compromised Democrats.The idea of America as a land of unbound self-invention is not new -- F. Scott Fitzgerald captured that in \"The Great Gatsby.\" America is about forgetting, hence the extravagance of its creations. Still, Trump's self-invention is remarkable for its scale and depravity -- the way he grasped how hyper-individualism, the money culture, simmering anger, and the collapse of the line between truth and falsehood could be channeled into a victorious presidential campaign. How, in short, he could become the orange icon of the Age of the Unicorn.The great parable of our age is John Carreyrou's \"Bad Blood,\" a remarkable account of how a 20-something Stanford dropout, Elizabeth Holmes, built a company called Theranos that fooled everyone with a supposedly transformational method to test blood. Holmes's pinprick testing that would do away with the hypodermic needle never worked. It was fakery.There was no there there in Theranos, There was only Holmes with her strange baritone parlaying zilch into a company once valued at an estimated $9 billion. She entranced a kind of American Who's Who -- including George Shultz, Jim Mattis and Henry Kissinger. Theranos was the ultimate \"unicorn\" -- the by the venture capitalist Aileen Lee to describe the several dozen software start-ups launched since 2003 and valued at $1 billion or more, companies that avoid the scrutiny of going public while raising vast sums.Belief in the Theranos unicorn split families. Shultz clashed with his grandson, Tyler Shultz, after working at Theranos. It also crossed party lines: President Barack Obama appointed Holmes as a presidential ambassador for global entrepreneurship. Joe Biden called Theranos \"the laboratory of the future.\" Holmes spoke -- with Chelsea Clinton beside her -- at a 2016 fund-raiser for the Clinton campaign.Myth and manipulation turned Holmes into a billionaire. She incarnated America's collective hallucination and corruption, its vertiginous loss of bearings.Theranos collapsed thanks to Carreyrou's . The Security and Exchange Commission charged Holmes with \"massive fraud\" (she settled), and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California indicted her on federal wire fraud and other charges. So much for that unicorn. Brexit, another, endures for now.The unicorn, let's recall, is a legendary creature believed over centuries to exert miraculous powers, particularly through its horn that -- as amulet or powdered -- as a prophylactic or antidote. Leonardo da Vinci wrote that only \"fair maidens\" could appease the unicorn's ferocity. The unicorn never existed. It was collective fantasy. That did not make belief in it less tenacious.We now have a full accounting of the unicorn-in-chief's world. I fear he still has America in his thrall."},

But that didn't stop her from getting on stage in high-heeled boots and taping a stand-up special for Netflix.\"I throw up an 'Exorcist' amount every day,\" said Schumer, who has an extreme form of nausea and vomiting called hyperemesis.\"If you had a good pregnancy, like if you're someone who enjoyed being pregnant,\" she said, putting her hand over her heart, \"I just hope your car flips over.\"Men have dominated stand-up comedy since before the days of Jack Benny. But as women have elbowed their way onto the stage more often, one kind of performance has been hard not to notice: pregnant comedians popping up on high-profile comedy specials, late-night shows, and in clubs.No longer seen as something vaguely unhip that gets in the way of the act and the microphone stand, a baby on the way is now a rich source of stand-up material: stretch marks, placentas and all., who has done two Netflix specials while pregnant, explained clogged ducts, lactation consultants and diapers -- for mom. (After the baby comes out, \"You know what else exits? Her house.\")Schumer lifted up her dress during her special, \"Growing,\" to show the bandages over her belly button trying to keep it flat., clearly pregnant under a rainbow sequined dress, cataloged the reasons she did not want children. (\"Does anyone else have people in their family that you don't want to make more of? I have a brother who lives in a van that he put an address on.\")And , comfortably into her third trimester, cheerfully mimed along while talking about masturbation.Just a few years ago, said Pazsitzky, who performs as Christina P., \"We were sort of hidden, it was considered not cool.\"\"When I got pregnant with my second child, things had definitely changed,\" she said. \"The managers and agents were all like: 'Cha-Ching! Cha-Ching! Where's the book deal? Where's the special?'\"Such performances would have been hard to imagine when the grande dame of American comedy, Joan Rivers, appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1967, while carrying her daughter, Melissa.\"I wasn't allowed to say I was pregnant,\" Rivers, , said in a 2007 interview. \"I was in a tent,\" she added of her poofy dress, \"and I had to say, 'soon I'll hear the pitter-patter of little feet.'\"Just four years ago, , a comedian and the host of NPR's trivia and comedy show, \"Ask Me Another,\" said that some bookers had warned her that she might alienate her audience by talking about her pregnancy on stage.\"For years we've heard men talk about their penises,\" she said, \"and we were supposed to accept that that's universal!\"And today? Forget the pitter-patter.\"All the questions everyone asks -- What are you having? Do you know what you're having?\" Schumer said in her Netflix special.Her answer: \"Hemorrhoids!\"So how did we get here?There is no comprehensive count of women in comedy, but comedians, club owners and bookers say there are more of them working today, even though they remain vastly outnumbered by men. And with women starting families later than they used to, these female comics are now more likely to have established careers by the time they start having babies.\"My peers and I kind of hit it, so to speak, just as you're right at the end of your fertility window,\" Pazsitzky, whose children are 9 months old and 3, said. \"I've worked 15 years to get here.\"Like most working women, she said, \"I can't take a year off to have a baby.\"So there they are, with an audience and microphone, and a whole lot of material.Wong: \"Breast-feeding is this savage ritual that just reminds you that your body is a cafeteria now.\"Leggero: \"The amount of weight I've gained, I'm not really in the glowing stage. I'm kind of in the what's-Natasha-sad-about stage.\"Schumer: \"I didn't throw up today!\"They were glad, they said, to have somewhere to channel the sci-fi surprises that come with growing a human.\"I think the first time I said it onstage was at a college, and they just seemed horrified,\" Leggero said of announcing her pregnancy to an audience. \"I was so excited to try the stuff because I had ideas and jokes I wanted to talk about. But they probably weren't the exact right crowd.\"As each passing trimester inspires new lines, some have to go. , a stand-up in Los Angeles who gave birth to her daughter this month (welcome, Rosalie!), said she had to lose a joke in which she explained to political conservatives how birth control worked, because she no longer looked like she had a vise grip on it herself.But she did keep a bit where she gets super low to the ground in a deep squat, imitating a very tiny person.\"Throughout the entire pregnancy, but in stand-up too, people treat you like you're very fragile,\" she said. \"I could feel the audience going like, 'Oooh, is she O.K., this precious glass figurine?' It's O.K.! I wouldn't do it if it wasn't okay.\"For women who have difficult pregnancies, the travel often required for stand-up can be a real challenge. In February, Schumer the remainder of her tour, saying that because of her hyperemesis she was no longer allowed to fly. \"I wanted to push through and do my shows,\" she posted on Instagram. \"Because I hate letting people down and I love stand up and money! But more than that I have to think about my health and the baby.\"Many comics, however, said there were advantages to plus-one performances.\"Anything remotely vulgar gets a bigger laugh when you're pregnant,\" Pazsitzky said. \"It's just more taboo. Any inappropriate hand gestures or obscene phrases are real crowd pleasers.\"Audiences can also be easier to win over. The comedian Bonnie McFarlane, whose daughter is now 11, said that she is heckled approximately every single show, but when she was visibly pregnant, she was heckled just once.She recalled: \"A woman said to me, 'I don't think you're really pregnant, I think you're just fat.'\"As fun as it can be to play with expectations about maternal behavior and delicate pregnant ladies, many comics look forward to the day that an expectant mom on stage is not unusual at all.\"When you are pregnant, you are very loudly a woman,\" said Jenny Hagel, a comedian and writer for \"Late Night With Seth Meyers,\" who did improv at New York City's Upright Citizens Brigade Theater until two weeks before her son was born. \"And we are programmed in our society that it is less appropriate for women to make jokes than it is for men.\"Then again, she added: \"Man-buns are normal now. We can get used to anything with conditioning.\""},

What will its name be? The shortest odds were on (1) this week and (2) Diana.But isn't it kind of icky to put money down on a woman's pregnancy? Even if that woman is Meghan Markle, arguably the most famous American in Britain, and definitely the best-known actress turned duchess there? Even if the baby is a Royal Baby?\"The idea of tens of thousands of strangers voting on the sex of your unborn baby is frankly bizarre, but it's part of the buildup to a royal birth and an acceptable part of the narrative,\" said Katie Nicholl, who comments on the royals for a living and wrote a book titled \"Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss, and Love.\"She added: \"It's generally seen as harmless fun, and an age-old tradition that's synonymous with royal births.\"It's also a chance to make a lot of money off a newborn. of Prince Harry and Ms. Markle -- now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- was popular with gamblers.There were guesses about her dress (Givenchy), his beard (intact) and the weather (lovely).But there are far more bets on Baby Sussex, who will be seventh in line to the throne. At the bookmaker William Hill, wagers are expected to reach $1.3 million. Another bookmaker, Boyle Sports, is taking bets on categories like the baby's godparents and weight.That's more action than for each of the baby's three royal cousins -- the children ofCatherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William, Prince Harry's brother -- who are third through fifth .On the BookMaker.eu website, odds favor the baby's being born in the morning on a Sunday, said Angus Hamilton, an entertainment specialist for the sports betting platform, who remembers similar wagers being placed when Princess Diana was pregnant.The betting market for royal babies is not enormous, Mr. Hamilton said. On BookMaker.eu, there is less than $100,000 in related wagers, compared with the $1 million in bets that the Oscars sometimes draw on the day of the ceremony.\"It's not college basketball or the Super Bowl, but it's a bit of fun,\" he said. \"Royal babies are big news in the U.K., but people are excited about this one in particular.\"That's why Tilletts, a jeweler in Norwich, is marking the birth by charging $5,500 for a jar of diaper rash cream. The lid is made of silver, engraved with the British and American flags and set with diamonds, inspired by \"the sparkling warmth and charm of Meghan's personality,\" according to the company.The proceeds will be sent to Ickle Pickles, a charity that provides intensive care equipment for premature babies.Baby Sussex is expected to be an economic stimulus for British pubs, restaurants, souvenir shops and museums, with an uptick in tourists, especially from the United States, said Richard Haigh, the managing director of Brand Finance, a consulting firm. Last year, it estimated that the Sussex wedding fueled $1.5 billion in spending.Immediately after the birth, sales of memorabilia and other baby-related products could reach nearly $100 million in Britain and the rest of Europe, with some related spending in North America, according to the Center for Retail Research in Norwich.Stores in Britain have already geared up for a boom in baby-related spending. a London company specializing in iced cookies, is marking Baby Sussex's birth with a luxury biscuit tin of decorated sweet treats featuring crowns and baby onesies that customers can buy for 45 pounds, or about $59.Sophie Allport, a British housewares brand, adorned with American flags and Union Jacks. The baby's name and date of birth will be applied to the inside rim of the mugs and delivered to customers after the birth.Not on the High Street, an online gifts retailer, is making the most of the regal fanfare by putting together a page of \"Royal-Baby-Worthy\" gifts that it says will have babies feeling \"like royalty.\"Brands will also be keeping an eye out to see if Baby Sussex makes , the kind of endorsement that can clear stores out of .\"From the day the pregnancy is announced, we see an increasing flow of traffic to the website and noticeable demand and searches online for classic and vintage-inspired clothing,\" said Pepa Gonzalez, founder of Pepa & Company. Her company made the outfits worn by the pageboy and flower girl at the 2017 wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's sister.In the child's first five years, the Center for Retail Research expects nearly $800 million in spending on Sussex-inspired children's wear and infant products. In the first two years, more than $130 million of those purchases will come from the United States.The Sussexes have had a complicated relationship with public attention and have opted to shun after the birth. In the past, these first moments in the glare of the press have also given the and adorning the mother and baby unparalleled publicity on newspaper front pages.But Ms. Markle will not be in seclusion. In the waning weeks of the pregnancy, the Sussexes started an Instagram account, which they used to ask well-wishers to donate to charities rather than send baby gifts. The account garnered a million followers in less than six hours, far faster than the previous record holders: Pope Francis and the K-pop star Kang Daniel, according to Guinness World Records."},

So a team of eight club staffers gets busy under his direction, pulling a potted plant from the terrace for one corner and setting up two dozen glowing amber votive candles. Mr. Ford himself redoes the white flowers, plucking out the roses and leaving in the ranunculus, because he doesn't like mixed blooms.The Murphy bed he can do nothing about.As I enter, the designer is lost in thought, still fantasizing about redoing the room in his own preferred palette, draping chocolate brown velvet on the walls.Everything in life can always be more sensual and beautiful, if you think about it. And Mr. Ford is always thinking about it.From the time he was big enough to push furniture, at 6 years old, he was rearranging it in his house, sometimes swapping his for his sister's. And giving his mother critiques on her hair and shoes.And that's why being Tom Ford is awful, in a way.He always sees what's wrong. And you can't help but feel bad for him because you know his flawless flaw detector is always on.\"I am a hyper-hyper Virgo,\" he said. \"Perfectionist, anal-retentive, supposedly. Seemingly uptight, seemingly aloof. We're definitely homebodies also. We love the home.\" (Or in his case, six.)Mr. Ford has been known to go to a movie in the middle of the day wearing a suit, and to make hospital corners with other people's slipcovers.\"I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse, but he actually can make things better,\" said the actress Rita Wilson, a friend. \"He's not afraid to say you need to cut three inches off your hair or lose weight.\"Even on vacations in the tropics or river rafting, she said, Mr. Ford looks eerily perfect. He used to tailor white T-shirts he bought at La Rinascente in Milan, but now he wears his own brand. \"The cut of the sleeve has to be just right if you want your biceps to look right,\" he said.In 2003, as the creative director of Gucci, he personally shaved a \"G\" in a model's pubic hair for an ad, adding definition with an eyebrow pencil.Lisa Eisner, who has done jewelry collaborations with Mr. Ford and inspired the Alessia character in his 2016 film, \",\" said that he doesn't expect everyone to be as persnickety as he is.\"At Graydon Carter's wedding, I drank way too much and ran out to go to the bathroom and got sick on his shoes -- really good Tom Ford shoes,\" she recalled. \"He just laughed and wiped it off.\" And his friends praise his fierce loyalty.Ms. Wilson recalled that after her breast cancer diagnosis in 2015, when she had to present at the Tonys feeling vulnerable because \"you have had part of your body removed,\" Mr. Ford designed her a beautiful dress to wear that \"made my shape look like a normal shape. And he did it with such sensitivity, generosity and love.\"Mr. Ford did not check his phone during the three hours we spent together. He has perfect posture and lovely Southern manners and stands up when you return to the table from the bathroom. His voice, as one fan wrote in a YouTube comment, sounds like what melted chocolate tastes like. Admiring the votives' golden aura, I confessed that I'm obsessed with lighting and have been known to unscrew bulbs in restaurant booths or flip off lights at parties.\"Oh, I do that,\" Mr. Ford said. \"At Tower Bar, if you go to my table, the corner table at the back, there are these overhead spots and on mine it's blacked out, because I told them, 'You have to get rid of that spot or I'm not going to come here. No overhead lights.'\"Jeff Klein, Mr. Ford's friend who is the hotelier behind both the bungalows and the Sunset Tower hotel where the Tower Bar is, called an electrician to put in a special switch for Mr. Ford's table, which can be flipped off when he's on his way.\"Why, oh my God, overhead light,\" Mr. Ford continued, warming to the subject, \"where your brow is going to create shadow right there, your nose is going to create a shadow like this, you look like hell, you look like you have no hair, even if you have a lot of hair. Nobody looks good in overhead lighting.\"That's why I don't go to Barry and Diane's lunch party,\" he confided, referring to one of the most coveted invitations in Hollywood, on Oscar weekend at the Coldwater Canyon mansion of and Diane von Furstenberg. \"I don't like the middle of the day. Take a picture at noon, anywhere in the world. You're going to look like hell -- Everybody looks like hell. Unless you're 18, maybe, or under. Even then you don't look your best. I like daylight, but not to go out in public.\"Mr. Ford cloaks himself in black, planted a black garden in London of black tulips and black calla lilies, contemplates death constantly and plans on designing a black sarcophagus. He is 57 but for decades has not seemed to get any older. And he's wearing Beau de Jour (one of 39 Tom Ford fragrances), a scent meant to evoke the allure of Cary Grant's neck.I told him that all this makes him a member of my favorite cult: sexy vampires.His face lit up. \"A vampire cape was one of the first things I got when I could tell my mother to make something for me, and it was black satin on the outside and red satin on the inside,\" he said. \"And I had the vampire teeth and I had the LP with the music from 'Dark Shadows.' I was obsessed and I wanted to be a vampire because vampires are sexy. They don't age. Talk about seductive. I'm not talking about Nosferatu, you know. But vampires were usually rich, they lived in a fabulous house or castle. Wore black. Vampires are great.\"Ms. Eisner demurred: \"Tom smells too good to be a vampire.\" She said that those who know Mr. Ford simply through the famous shots of him with naked models and actresses probably think he's \"a sex pervert, someone who thinks about sex 24-7. Nope, he's not that guy at all. He's very loyal to his friends. Very married.\"Richard Buckley, Mr. Ford's husband since 2013, confirmed that the facade of gleaming black lacquer is deceiving.\"The one misconception I think most people have of Tom is that he is some kind of press whore who loves to have his picture taken,\" said Mr. Buckley, a longtime fashion journalist with whom Mr. Ford had a coup de foudre during an elevator ride 32 years ago. \"He is, and always has been, shy,\" Mr. Buckley said. \"He did acting when he was in his early 20s, so he is able to 'turn on' for interviews.\" Referring to their 6-year-old son, he added: \"And Jack has never been photographed. In London, we have a court injunction to keep any newspaper or magazine from running pictures of him. In Los Angeles, there is a law.\" (The designer takes Jack -- who already prefers black despite drawers filled with colorful clothes -- every day to school, where \"the mothers have to see Tom Ford looking great at 8 in the morning while they look like hell,\" an amused Ms. Eisner noted.)Mr. Buckley, 70, said dryly that their lives are not \"all champagne and caviar,\" opening up about his nightmarish struggle with the aftereffects of radiation for the throat cancer for which he had surgery for in 1989, three years after the men became involved.\"Tom has seen me through so much, from throat cancer to my brother and mother dying 48 hours apart, to more bouts of pneumonia than I can count,\" Mr. Buckley said.Mr. Ford made his husband gray merino wool turtleneck dickeys with keyhole slits for his tracheotomy tube, and, for formal events, a black silk scarf with slits.\"Tom is actually quite good at sewing,\" Mr. Buckley said. (These days, a designer need not be.)Recently, it was announced that Mr. Ford will succeed Ms. von Furstenberg as the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, a job he was persuaded to take by her and Anna Wintour.\"He's a cross between a Rolls-Royce and the Marlboro Man,\" Ms. von Furstenberg told me. At a time when Donald Trump's America is turning away from the rest of the world, Mr. Ford, who has spent half his life working and studying in Europe, says he will reach out because \"if American fashion is going to flourish, it has got to drop the idea that it's American fashion and become global.\"\"It's a turbulent time in some ways for fashion, which has been rightly criticized for its lack of inclusivity, for not having enough women in C.E.O. positions,\" Ms. Wintour said. \"These are things Tom cares about.\"Indeed, back in the Gucci days, Mr. Ford was one of the first designers to prominently feature African-American and Asian models on the runway and in ad campaigns. said that Mr. Ford stands out because he's \"not like most of the cruel snakes in fashion and in cutthroat business. His is an unapologetic universe of sultry, melting-pot sexuality, often fusing or blurring the genders.\"Virgil Abloh, the creator of Off-White and the artistic director of men's wear at Louis Vuitton, said that, at the C.F.D.A., Mr. Ford will not be \"just a puppet of the industry going with the flow. He has rigor in his work and his personality, and he will bring challenging ideas.\"Mr. Abloh said that Mr. Ford's provocative Gucci ads inspired him when he was a teenager in Illinois, into skateboarding, hip-hop and normcore. \"I was an outsider,\" he said, \"and he made me believe in fashion.\"Women's Wear Daily that Mr. Ford was the buyer, for $18 million, of the Paul Rudolph modernist four-story townhouse on 63rd Street in Manhattan where Halston once lived, hosting some of the wildest parties of the 1970s (Mr. Ford's favorite decade) for glitterati like Truman Capote, Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Liza Minnelli.In Los Angeles, Mr. Ford lives in a $39 million Holmby Hills mansion, formerly owned by Betsy Bloomingdale, that is a study in black and white, complete with a Scottish butler named Angus. He also has property in Santa Fe, where his family moved when he was 11, including a $75 million ranch, which he's selling, that includes a Western movie town used to shoot such movies as \"Cowboys and Aliens\" and \"All the Pretty Horses.\" When a colleague told him that the Rudolph place had been on sale for eight years, he snapped it up.\"I've kind of lived in that house in my mind for many years,\" Mr. Ford said. \"It has dark brown glass, it has a garage, it has a .\" There are 32-foot-high ceilings, skylights galore and a roof garden. New York had long seemed stressful. \"It felt like all work, if I walked down the street and somebody saw me, they would get on the phone and call so-and-so and then so-and-so would say, 'You need to come to my party,' and 'You need to go to her opening,' and 'So-and-so needs to see you,' and it just wasn't fun.\"But then he thought about his son. \"I love L.A.,\" he said, \"but I do want Jack to know how to put on a jacket, go to a restaurant, go to a museum, walk on the street, go to a play.\"Mr. Ford first visited his new house in the heyday of Studio 54, which is where, after years of dating women, he realized he was gay.He was studying art history in his freshman dorm room one night, feeling disoriented about the move to New York. \"I just said, 'Oh my God, please, please, please let something happen to me.' Knock, knock, knock. I went to the door and there was Ian Falconer, this guy from art history class, in a little blue blazer, and he said, 'Do you want to go to Studio?' And I said, 'Are you kidding me, Studio 54?' And he said, 'Yeah, I'm going with some friends.'\"One of the friends was Andy Warhol, who picked them up in a Cadillac limousine. \"The stretch Cadillacs were fabulous. There were two jump seats in the back. And it was literally like a movie, everyone got pushed aside and we walked right in the door. 'Oh my God, here I am, Studio 54 for the very first time' and I drank a lot, did a lot of coke.\"Even back then, he always visualized the sort of cinematic life he has now, with several Warhols on the wall, including a triptych of vulvas and a \"Big Electric Chair.\" He sold a fright-wig self-portrait of the artist at Sotheby's for $32.6 million to pay for his stores in China.That night at Studio 54 was the first night he ended up with a man, and it \"freaked\" him out. \"And I said to him, 'This was great but this isn't really what I do or who I am' and I went back to my dorm room. And I tried to sort of deny that, and then I remember friends that were gay saying, 'Why are you dating a girl? You're really gay.' I suppose I struggled with it for maybe six months. Maybe it was coming from my family background in Texas where, you know, guys are guys. I was nervous about telling my parents, but they're liberal Democrats who met at the University of Texas and it was pre-AIDS and they were totally cool with it.\" (His parents were real estate agents.)\"And I learned later on that it was a plus because people thought if you weren't gay, you couldn't possibly be a good designer.\"Tom Ford is elegantly dressed, naturally, all in Tom Ford: a black double 002 watch with a removable woven leather band; a white cotton French cuff shirt (\"because it's one of the only things a man can have, a pair of cuff links\"); trousers, plain-weave; the black velvet peak lapel jacket favored by Hollywood moguls; and a pair of black cap-toe Chelsea boots. Men in Los Angeles never wear the proper shoes, in his opinion.\"I don't feel secure in a slip-on or a tennis shoe,\" he said. \"I think it's the Texan in me. I could never go to a business meeting in a tennis shoe. You feel soft, bouncy, not in control. I don't feel good in sweaters either, when I'm out. I feel soft and mushy and vulnerable. I need my armor.\"What about that time in St. Barts when he was nude on the beach and Anna Wintour happened to walk by?A talented mimic, Mr. Ford describes the awkward moment: \"'Hi, Richard. Hi, Tom.' And I'm like, 'Oh, hi, Anna!' Oh, I'm naked! It was a wake-up call.\"(When I asked Ms. Wintour about it, she answered breezily: \"Everyone was naked in St. Barts in those days. And it happened, I'm sure Tom looked as perfect as he always does.\")Politicians also need their armor, and Mr. Ford, who toggles from Turner Classic Movies to MSNBC to CNN to the BBC, was happy to muse about makeovers for them.On Hillary Clinton: \"I supported Hillary but when she talks to a camera she lifts her chin and all of the sudden, it's a haughty pose. Now Princess Diana, when she answered a question, she would look up at you from underneath doe eyes, which made you go, 'awww.'\"On Elizabeth Warren: \"She needs shoulder pads!\"On Kamala Harris: \"She looks great.\"On Pete Buttigieg: \"I started thinking of advice for Mayor Pete and Chasten, but then I realized what's so great about them is that they're so natural.\"On President Trump: \"He's a very tall man, but he's also not the slimmest thing. The elongated ties, it's one more vertical that could, in his head, make him feel slimmer. He also never buttons his jacket, which I find very odd. I've run around rooms at a party buttoning people's jackets because it gives you a waist.\" And what about the time Mr. Trump Scotch-taped the back of his tie? \"Well, Scotch tape a miracle,\" Mr. Ford allowed.He was drinking a Coke with his grilled artichoke and cauliflower steak, having become vegan, allowing himself the occasional piece of salmon, after watching the documentary \"What the Health.\" He cheats with baked goods, jelly beans, Starbursts and Skittles. \"Sugar is my weakness,\" he said. He weighs himself daily, holding at 165 pounds, and hasn't had a drink for 10 years.\"For several years leading up to stopping drinking -- because I drank a lot -- on the mornings after, I would have to send flowers to this one and flowers to that one and, 'Oh, I can't believe I did that' and 'I can't believe I said that,' and I told Richard for at least a year, 'Oh my God, I wish I could just not drink at all.' And the drinking was the open door for the drugs. Three drinks\" -- he mimes sniffing a line -- \"and anything I could hoover, anything was going to happen.\"Living in London for 17 years didn't help. \"You go to lunch there, you have two or three drinks,\" he said. \"In my office at 5 o'clock, cocktail hour started, because we work in fashion until 8 or 9, so you're drinking, so now we're up to five drinks.\" By day's end he might be up to a dozen.When Mr. Ford moved to the land of green juice and kind bud, culture shock ensued. \"I was at an afternoon party at a friend's house, and Martin Short said to me, 'Do you think you might have a drinking problem?' Because it was lunch and I was just kicking back the vodka tonics and I didn't think anything of it. It was the first indication I had that, 'oh, maybe this isn't normal.'\"He worked with a therapist for a year, tapered off and then one weekend just stopped. Mr. Ford's critically acclaimed movies, \"Nocturnal Animals\" and \"A Single Man\" (2009), are so drenched in color that they bring to mind the mesmerizing luminosities of Venetian painting.\"I don't allow the cinematographer to see the film until I'm finished with it because I have very specific ideas and I sit there, frame by frame, on the computer and color-correct every scene,\" Mr. Ford said. \"And I have the ability to take those mandarin oranges and pop them and then desaturate the rest of the image. And you can manipulate the colors, so it is really like painting.\"He had a new film deal fall apart on him last summer, and he has just bought the rights to a 600-page book he won't name but has been wanted to adapt for 12 years.Naturally, he's looking for more control. \"In fashion, we would never design something and then hand it off to somebody else to advertise it,\" he pointed out. \"All movie trailers sound the same and look the same. I guess what I've learned is that there's this sort of myth that it's a magic thing that only professionals know how to do and I just don't buy into that anymore because I feel like I know how to do it better.\"I was surprised to learn he has an aversion to color in his clothes and homes. He tried some, aside from the art, in his Santa Fe home but quickly backtracked because it was too \"challenging.\" He even painted the bright yellow tractors on the ranch black, to go along with his black Angus cattle, black horses and black backhoes.\"I don't like color on me because I don't like to scream, I like to recede in a way,\" he said. \"I was always shy and so I would feel silly in a bright color.\"He said he feels enormous empathy for women who get frightened about their looks fading. \"There's nothing more powerful in our culture than a beautiful woman,\" he said. But \"it's an unsustainable thing. One day it stops. And I have lived through it with so many female friends and part of my job is to imagine myself, the female version of myself, would I want to wear that? Where would I go in it? How would I feel in it? Would I feel vulnerable?\"(Mr. Ford said if he were a woman, he would be Ali MacGraw.)He confessed that his hair \"is a little more salt and pepper than it looks. I mean, Diana Vreeland stayed with black hair all the way until the end.\"I've been open about using Botox and fillers, although I can move. You have to be very careful with it. I do it about once every eight months. When I go to the dermatologist, I get a hand mirror, I take a white pencil and I say, 'Right there.' If I could do it myself, I would.\"Now that he is a parent (and no longer walking naked around the house, as he once did), does he feel the need to tone down the sexuality of his fashion ads?\"Oh, yes, absolutely,\" he said, adding that it may also be because of \"the hyper-politically correct culture. I mean, you can't say anything anymore. I was shooting an ad campaign last week, and the guy came up behind the girl and was kissing her on the neck and he was holding her wrists from the back and I said, 'No, no, we have to change that. Put his hand in her hand.' I don't know that any of us will survive this scrutiny.\"His friend and collaborator, the photographer Terry Richardson, was banned from Conde Nast and several fashion houses as part of a wave of #MeToo accusations.\"Ugh! I love Terry,\" he said. \"And I have to say that I never in my entire life saw any of that with Terry. One of my assistants went out with Terry for two years and he was the kindest, gentlest person in the relationship.\"I wondered about the fracases over cultural appropriation. \"Two shows ago, I showed the girls with scarves on their head, which were not and that was not where that idea came from,\" he said, adding that it came from the '70s, which I know to be true, because I wore them in college. \"And a couple of people wrote that it was durags and appropriation. Well, first of all, if you're appropriating something, why isn't that great? You're celebrating it.\"After we split a lemon meringue pie, the designer dropped me at my hotel in his chauffeured Range Rover. The next day I flew home. On the plane, I saw a picture of Priyanka Chopra on Page Six, the gossip section of The New York Post. She was wearing the same Tom Ford red ruched tulle dress that I wore for the interview. With horror, I realized that I had been wearing my velvet corset belt backward all night, with the hooks behind and laces in front.Mr. Ford was too polite to mention it. "},

That liquefied grape jelly was our house wine, and she served it every week on the Sabbath and on every holiday.Even after I stopped observing Sabbath rules myself, and made my professional life in wine, my mother could never quite grasp my desperation to find something palatable for Passover. Each year, I'd plunk down way too much money, hopes high, expectations low, ferrying the rabbi-approved bottles over to Mom's apartment in Long Beach. Somewhere around the second cup, Ethel would ask, \"You know what this needs?\" and mix some of her sweet Concord with the $35 kosher Burgundy I'd brought.I was brought up in a kosher and fairly observant household, and attended 12 years of religious school. I was raised to go to the women's college at Yeshiva University, not Stony Brook, and I certainly wasn't supposed become a wine writer. But I did both of those things. And almost 20 years ago, I dedicated myself to the cause of natural wine: organic viticulture with none of the more than 70 legal additives -- things like yeast, bacteria, tannin, acid, anti-foaming agents and wood chips -- that may be present in most wines, kosher or otherwise. The secular bottles I drink are mostly made from one ingredient: grapes. Natural wine is unpredictable. It boasts a huge variation in flavors. The winemaker's goal is to translate the place the grapes come from into the glass, and each bottle carries an imprint of what happened the year it was made. These wines bear no resemblance to conventional or kosher wines that often follow a cookie-cutter path, full of additives to get them there. Those wines are not ones I want to sip at the holiday or any table.Not long ago, that only my kind of wine is fit for the Eucharist. Which leads to the fifth question of my Passover celebration: Why, on this night, am I unable to find any kosher natural wines?Well, I should say that there are two worthy options, both made in minute amounts: Harkham from Australia and Camuna in Berkeley, Calif. There should be more. Before World War II, before the boom in the use of additives, most wines were natural or natural enough. Jewish winemakers and vineyard owners produced kosher wine, most famously in Hungary, where winemaking families like the sflourished. The Holocaust destroyed that heritage.My Yiddish-speaking grandfather, who was born in Ukraine in the 19th century, did remember this natural wine tradition. He made wine in our basement. One of my earliest memories of Pop, who taught me to smell everything before I drank it, was his despairing over a batch of his wine that had turned to vinegar. When it worked though, it was delicious.Kosher isn't about being blessed; it's about being watched and being handled only by Sabbath observers from ferment to corkscrew -- a rule that was an attempt to protect against wine being used for idolatry.There is one workaround: boiling. Such wines are labeled \"mevushal\" and a pagan (or even a lapsed yeshiva girl like me) can serve any kosher wine that has been boiled, flash-pasteurized or made from heated grapes, to anyone, even the very religious. While modern methods for this technique are far kinder, hot grapes do not make the best wine and prevent natural ferments. That means adding yeasts and nutrients. Anyone who cares about wine will opt for a cocktail instead at religious weddings.But at Passover, it's wine you need, and at my mother's table it needs to be kosher. That's why last year I tried to make my own: traditional, authentic, kosher and natural.This was a deeply personal project. That is, I understood that not that many other people are in the market for natural kosher wine, yet. After all, how can you know what you're missing if it doesn't exist? \"No one cares and no one knows what they want because they don't have the exposure,\" David Raccah, who writes the blog Kosher Wine Musings and drinks only kosher, told me.It was also an expensive and logistically difficult endeavor. Kosher certification can cost up to $10,000 a year.I set out to make my wine in the country of Georgia, since I have written about winemaking there and I knew I could get affordable grapes and work space. I had a religious friend of a friend lined up to handle the wine for me and take my instruction. All I had to do was figure out how to pay for the kosher certification and deal with the bureaucracy.It wasn't easy to reach the rabbi in Tbilisi. He was in constant demand, always rushing out to Kutaisi for a bris or to Bagdati for a wedding.Finally, I got him over Skype. After a long treatise on the religious laws and why I, a now-secular Jewish natural wine lover, would never be able to make my wine, we were disconnected. I called back. Friends in Tbilisi tried to reach him. The harvest of 2018 came and went. His dismissiveness just made me want to do it even more.Making wine is risky. You need the right soil blessed with the right climate. You need talent. And without additives, you need knowledge and a little luck. I have a plan in place and another rabbi lined up for this year. I'm determined to make something that Ethel and her friends can enjoy.Do we ever outgrow our desire for a parent's understanding? Even if there was another decade left, my mother will never quite understand or accept my rejection of religious life. But if she understands why I devoted decades of my life to writing about this magical, enduring symbol of life, culture and humanity, that would suit me even better. But to do that, she needs to be able to drink it.Alice Feiring is the author of \"The Dirty Guide to Wine: Following Flavor From Ground to Glass\" and the forthcoming \"Natural Wine for the People: What It Is, Where to Find It, How to Love It.\""},

The fire that broke out at Notre-Dame this week is a historic event of our times.Monday night, even before the flames had been quenched, while we were still wondering whether the cathedral's two towers would withstand the fire, the incident had already become a symbol -- many symbols. It was a sinister omen of France's decline, some promptly said. , it was a sign of the fragility of Western democracy and civilization.On Tuesday, the environmental activist Greta Thunberg, seeing in the building's embers the image of an incandescent Earth, told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, \"Notre-Dame will be rebuilt,\" and urged the legislators to save the planet, too, by shifting gears to President Emmanuel Macron solemnly declared: \"\" Notre-Dame, he vowed, would be restored within five years. Celebrating the Paris firefighters' heroic work in bringing the blaze under control, , \"The state and public authorities often are criticized. But in moments such as these, the entire nation knows how to organize itself.\"In no time, it seemed, the charred cathedral became a rallying cry for bringing together a fractured country -- a way for France \",\" Mr. Macron said. But how could one not see behind these grand pronouncements that this fire already was obscuring a slower but vaster one that has been burning steadily for months, on occasion literally torching cars and upscale Parisian restaurants? Since November, the so-called Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) have demonstrated throughout the country against the rise in inequalities and the drop in living standards, claiming as well that French democracy is not representative enough. History has a sense of irony. France's most famous monument ignited Monday evening just as Mr. Macron was expected to address the country on television and explain how his government proposed to put out that social brazier. His speech was postponed, understandably, and for a few hours much of France focused its attention on Paris' historic center, which it usually turns over to tourists.But history also is cruel. Only a little bit of information about the government's proposed reforms has been disclosed, and it's difficult to imagine that it will have any of the soothing, much less redemptive, effects the government may have hoped for. If anything, the Macron administration's continued vagueness about major demands -- a wealth tax, greater democratic participation -- suggests that it is still dead-set on reducing deficits and refusing to put pressure on the rich, that it will not bow to the Yellow Vests' demands for fiscal justice. Yet even as the government was whimpering, in effect, that the country's coffers were running low, money came pouring in for a cathedral.In a matter of hours, Francois-Henri Pinault, one of France's wealthiest men, offered 100 million euros to rebuild Notre-Dame; Bernard Arnault, who heads the luxury brand LVMH, offered 200 million. Within less than two days, for the cathedral's reconstruction.A journalist sarcastically asked Philippe Martinez, the leader of a major labor union, whether the flood of donations was evidence of trickle-down economics. \",\" Mr. Martinez answered, adding that the outburst of generosity from French billionaires only exposed the inequalities that divide the country. Such gifts aren't just a private matter; they cost the state, too. For one thing, and certainly in the eyes of some Yellow Vests, these philanthropists are offering only a small fraction of enormous fortunes they have amassed partly by avoiding taxes otherwise needed to fund basic public services. And since their proposed gifts are destined for France's national heritage, the bulk of them could benefit from major tax exemptions -- up to 90 percent were to pass.A number of state bodies also have offered to contribute, drawing on strained budgets. Laurent Wauquiez, who heads both the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region and the conservative party Les Republicains, has offered . Other local governments have followed suit.The rush to rebuild Notre-Dame, however well-intentioned, risks only underscoring the government's slowness in helping the people whose lives, some say, have been ruined by neoliberalism and globalization. France's elites quote Victor Hugo in the name of saving the cathedral he wrote about, apparently forgetting that he also wrote \"Les Miserables.\" It is a sad, and dangerous, signal to be sending. That other, greater, fire still needs putting out.

I'm confident that I'm not the only White House counsel from a past administration to read it with particular attention to the details, less technical, that illuminated the extraordinary challenge within this presidency: the relationship between a president heedless of legal constraints and the government lawyers who answer to the public for the rule of law. This is the importance of Mr. Mueller's account of the struggles between President Trump and his White House counsel, Donald McGahn. We should be grateful for Mr. McGahn's resistance to presidential wrongdoing while appreciating that we may need to reconsider and revise the norms and expectations governing the role of lawyers, and the White House counsel in particular. The president directed Mr. McGahn to fire Mr. Mueller, and Mr. McGahn rightly refused. This is not a case where a president, agitated about a development, reviews his concerns with his counsel and solicits his best advice. Mr. Trump insisted on preposterous claims about conflicts that ostensibly disqualified Mr. Mueller and ordered Mr. McGahn to make sure that the Justice Department removed the special counsel from his post. Mr. Trump's motives were clear: Only three days before, he had learned that an investigation into his possible commission of obstruction had begun.Mr. McGahn had to threaten to resign to stop the president's repeated insistence that he fire Mr. Mueller. Implored by senior White House staff members to stay on the job, he did, knowing he would be working for a president who had attempted to use him to end a federal investigation.When the story of Mr. Trump's order and Mr. McGahn's refusal to follow it became public, the president not only demanded that his White House Counsel deny the report. He also insisted on the creation of a false official record to substantiate the lie. He also had a staff secretary, Rob Porter, advise Mr. McGahn that he would be fired if he didn't do what the president wanted. Once again, Mr. McGahn refused to comply.The president called his lawyer a \"lying bastard\" but did not move to replace him. To say that this was an unhealthy relationship between a president and his White House counsel is an understatement. But the institutional issues are still more serious.For some time, there has been an active debate about whether the position of White House counsel is even viable. Critics have condemned it as a nesting place for presidential loyalists with law degrees who will tell the president exactly what he or she wants to hear. There is always the risk of that. The president can pick his own counsel. If he selects for loyalty, then he might suffer the consequences of having a committed political ally if, perhaps, not much of a lawyer. Mr. Trump, in picking Mr. McGahn, did not wind up with a loyalist. Mr. McGahn made it commendably clear to the president that he was an institutional lawyer, not his personal lawyer, and that their conversations about matters before the special counsel were not privileged. But it became clear to him, as it did to James Comey, that the president expected \"loyalty\" higher than any obligation to the public.The conflict over the order to fire Mr. Mueller was not the only occasion on which Mr. McGahn observed the president's indifference to legal limits. He was also aware that in the face of the regulation that made the decision inescapable, the president would not accept Attorney General Jeff Sessions's decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. The president even enlisted Mr. McGahn in the campaign to have Mr. Sessions \"unrecuse.\" Here again, Mr. McGahn relayed the message to the attorney general but did not push Mr. Sessions to reverse course.The episode raises the question of the obligations of a White House counsel when he realizes that he is the lawyer for a fundamentally dishonest president who is ready to violate the criminal law to achieve self-interested or political ends. The counsel in these circumstances may have to consider what it means for him to remain in this post for a president who considers him a \"lying bastard\" for refusing to follow an unlawful order.Mr. McGahn perhaps stayed on in the belief that the larger objectives of the administration, like moving judicial nominations and achieving deregulation, were well worth pursuing. But that is a judgment more about the administration's policy imperatives than the working conditions required for the maintenance of the rule of law in the presidency.The choice Mr. McGahn faced was unprecedented. He was not, for example, in the position of John Dean, White House counsel to Richard Nixon, who did testify against the president in the Watergate affair but who was an original party to the wrongdoing that ended that presidency. There has never been a suggestion that Mr. McGahn ever encouraged or participated in unlawful activities.In fact, Mr. McGahn acted appropriately and admirably to resist involvement in the president's scheme to commit obstruction and cooperated truthfully and at length with Mr. Mueller's investigation. The special counsel declared him a \"credible\" witness with no discernible motive to lie or exaggerate, and accepted his account over the president's denials.But should a future White House counsel have a clear obligation to alert the Department of Justice when the president attempts to obstruct justice? Federal law mandates that department and agency employees alert the attorney general to \"any information\" that relates to \"violations of federal criminal law\" involving government officers and employees. The code of ethics for government service requires reporting of \"corruption\" to the authorities. The application of these requirements to the president's White House counsel poses unique and difficult issues, but they need to be confronted.And what does the discovery of the president's lawless instincts -- or the president's belief that his lawyer is a \"lying bastard\"-- mean for the counsel's continued service? A lawyer in this situation could conclude that he should not serve such a president, or that, lacking a relationship of mutual trust and confidence, he cannot function in the role. Mr. McGahn was stuck working with a president who, pressuring his counsel to end an investigation and fake records about a presidential order, also admonished him for taking notes. \"Lawyers don't take notes,\" he told Mr. McGahn, and Mr. Trump urged on him the role model of Roy Cohn, counsel to Senator Joe McCarthy.This is unexplored ground. In the government of a president like Mr. Trump, a White House counsel faces unprecedented challenges, and we might reflect on options for answering them beyond the threat or act of resignation.

{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/opinion/mueller-report-trump-counterintelligence.html", "title": "Mueller Hints at a National-Security Nightmare", "authors": "", "contents": "The Mueller report isn't actually close to a full account of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. That's not just because of the redactions. When he was hired, Mr. Mueller inherited supervision of an F.B.I. investigation. That is the of the Mueller report.President Trump may claim \"exoneration\" on a narrowly defined criminal coordination charge. But a counterintelligence investigation can yield something even more important: an intelligence assessment of how likely it is that someone -- in this case, the president -- is acting, wittingly or unwittingly, under the influence of or in collaboration with a foreign power. Was Donald Trump a knowing or unknowing Russian asset, used in some capacity to undermine our democracy and national security?The public Mueller report alone provides enough evidence to worry that America's own national security interests may not be guiding American foreign policy.The counterintelligence investigation is not necessarily complete, but from the glimpses we see in the Mueller report, it should set off very serious national security alarm bells.An intelligence assessment makes two determinations: a conclusion about the type of influence a foreign power may have over an individual and the degree of confidence in that conclusion. For example, when Mr. Trump boasted to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in the Oval Office that he had fired the F.B.I. director, it raised only the possibility -- a \"circumstantial inference,\" as it's called in counterintelligence -- that the president was wittingly working on behalf of the Russians. This apparent desire to please these officials indicates a high level of Russian influence and, in the context of other actions that pleased Mr. Putin, like his sudden decision to withdraw American troops from Syria -- could support a modest to high level of confidence in that conclusion.But reaching very high confidence that Mr. Trump is wittingly doing Moscow's bidding would require something we don't have and would not expect to have, like an email from Vladimir Putin ordering Mr. Trump to fire the F.B.I. director James Comey.Similarly, there is no \"smoking gun\" order in the incidents below. They indicatea strong influence by the Russians, but only low to moderate confidence that he acted at Russia's behest. There's simply noclear sign that Mr. Trump was following directions of acting under pressure from the Kremlin. The former Trump adviser Roger Stone directly communicates with the Russia-linked actor Guccifer 2.0 and coordinates with WikiLeaks to get Mr. Trump elected -- and he is likely aware that one is a Russian front organization and the other is working with the Russians.A Trump campaign national security adviser is informed by a Russian intelligence operative that the Kremlin has stolen Hillary Clinton-related emails and could assist the Trump campaign through \"anonymous release\" of derogatory information; the campaign then works on setting up backdoor meetings with senior Russian government officials (though the meetings do not materialize).Members of the Trump transition team conduct secretive, back channel meetings with Putin operatives.Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin speak alone in Helsinki, then Mr. Trump accepts Mr. Putin's claim that he didn't meddle in the 2016 election and repudiates the intelligence community's assessments to the contrary.Those incidents raise the that Mr. Trump has wittingly sought to advance Russian interests, but the evidence is merely circumstantial and consequently suggests low to moderate confidence in that assessment. In many but not all respects, witting assets can be more dangerous because they have deliberately entered into some sort of understanding or agreement to work on behalf of the foreign power's interests. But unwitting assets pose their own dangers. They have significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited with minimal actual coordination. In other words, they look and act more like puppets.In the following examples, Mr. Trump appears a potentially unwitting but responsive asset for Moscow, a finding in which there seems greater confidence:Mr. Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn reassures Russia that United States sanctions for election interference will be reversed, then lies about his conversation to the F.B.I. Mr. Trump publicly applauds Mr. Putin's lack of retaliation for the sanctions.Mr. Trump pursues a potentially lucrative Trump Tower Moscow project through the end of the campaign and at least implicitly encourages his lawyer to lie to Congress about the timing of the deal.The stark realityis that one might have a moderate to high confidence that decisions are being made by an American president who, in the process of getting elected and after assuming office, has acted with the interests of an often-hostile foreign power influencing him.And that conclusion is deeply worrisome as a national security matter.A failure by political leaders to condemn the activities of a Trump campaign that openly welcomed Russian hacking and privately encouraged timely releases of damaging information about the campaign's opponent would put our nation at further risk.As president, Mr. Trump has taken a series of steps at home and abroad that advance Russian policy interests. At home, he has weakened American democracy, all but paralyzed our ability to act through legislation and vilified key institutions -- particularly law enforcement and the intelligence community. Abroad, Mr. Trump has weakened NATO, given Russia an increasingly free hand in Syria, minimized sanctions against Russian actors, questioned America's commitment to protecting Eastern Europe from Russian aggression and defended Mr. Putin on the world stage.It's hard to look toward the 2020 election with anything but concern -- we have not come far enough to protect the democratic process from the threat of foreign election interference, and one reason may well be that the man in the Oval Office has been compromised and continues to be influenced, wittingly or otherwise, by a Kremlin eager to see the United States remain vulnerable.Joshua A.

Some 90 percent have seen their incomes stagnate or decline in the past 30 years. This is not surprising, given that the among the advanced countries and one of the lowest levels of opportunity -- with the fortunes of young Americans more dependent on the income and education of their parents than elsewhere.But things don't have to be that way. There is an alternative: progressive capitalism. Progressive capitalism is not an oxymoron; we can indeed channel the power of the market to serve society.In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan's regulatory \"reforms,\" which reduced the ability of government to curb the excesses of the market, were sold as great energizers of the economy. But just the opposite happened: Growth slowed, and weirder still, this happened in the innovation capital of the world.The sugar rush produced by President Trump's largess to corporations in the didn't deal with any of these long-run problems, and is already fading. Growth is expected to be a little under .This is where we've descended to, but not where we have to stay. A progressive capitalism based on an understanding of what gives rise to growth and societal well-being gives us a way out of this quagmire and a way up for our living standards.Standards of living began to improve in the late 18th century for two reasons: the development of science (we learned how to learn about nature and used that knowledge to increase productivity and longevity) and developments in social organization (as a society, we learned how to work together, through institutions like the rule of law, and democracies with checks and balances). Key to both were systems of assessing and verifying the truth. The real and long-lasting danger of the Trump presidency is the risk it poses to these pillars of our economy and society, its attack on the very idea of knowledge and expertise, and its hostility to institutions that help us discover and assess the truth.There is a broader social compact that allows a society to work and prosper together, and that, too, has been fraying. America created the first truly middle-class society; now, a middle-class life is increasingly out of reach for its citizens.America arrived at this sorry state of affairs because we forgot that the true source of the wealth of a nation is the creativity and innovation of its people. One can get rich either by adding to the nation's economic pie or by grabbing a larger share of the pie by exploiting others -- abusing, for instance, market power or informational advantages. We confused the hard work of wealth creation with wealth-grabbing (or, as economists call it, rent-seeking), and too many of our talented young people followed the siren call of getting rich quickly.Beginning with the Reagan era, economic policy played a key role in this dystopia: Just as forces of globalization and technological change were contributing to growing inequality, we adopted policies that worsened societal inequities. Even as economic theories like information economics (dealing with the ever-present situation where information is imperfect), behavioral economics and game theory arose to explain why markets on their own are often not efficient, fair, stable or seemingly rational, we relied more on markets and scaled back social protections. The result is an economy with more exploitation -- whether it's abusive practices in the financial sector or the technology sector using our own data to take advantage of us at the cost of our privacy. The weakening of antitrust enforcement, and the failure of regulation to keep up with changes in our economy and the innovations in creating and leveraging market power, meant that markets became more concentrated and less competitive.Politics has played a big role in the increase in corporate rent-seeking and the accompanying inequality. Markets don't exist in a vacuum; they have to be structured by rules and regulations, and those rules and regulations must be enforced. Deregulation of the financial sector allowed bankers to engage in both excessively risky activities and more exploitive ones. Many economists understood that trade with developing countries would drive down American wages, especially for those with limited skills, and destroy jobs. We could and should have provided more assistance to affected workers (just as we should provide assistance to workers who lose their jobs as a result of technological change), but corporate interests opposed it. A weaker labor market conveniently meant lower labor costs at home to complement the cheap labor businesses employed abroad.We are now in a vicious cycle: Greater economic inequality is leading, in our money-driven political system, to more political inequality, with weaker rules and deregulation causing still more economic inequality.If we don't change course matters will likely grow worse, as machines (artificial intelligence and robots) replace an increasing fraction of routine labor, including many of the jobs of the several million Americans making their living by driving.The prescription follows from the diagnosis: It begins by recognizing the vital role that the state plays in making markets serve society. We need regulations that ensure strong competition without abusive exploitation, realigning the relationship between corporations and the workers they employ and the customers they are supposed to serve. We must be as resolute in combating market power as the corporate sector is in increasing it.If we had curbed exploitation in all of its forms and encouraged wealth creation, we would have had a more dynamic economy with less inequality. We might have curbed the opioid crisis and avoided the 2008 financial crisis. If we had done more to blunt the power of oligopolies and strengthen the power of workers, and if we had held our banks accountable, the sense of powerlessness might not be so pervasive and Americans might have greater trust in our institutions.There are many other areas in which government action is required. Markets on their own won't provide insurance against some of the most important risks we face, such as unemployment and disability. They won't efficiently provide pensions with low administrative costs and insurance against inflation. And they won't provide an adequate infrastructure or a decent education for everyone or engage in sufficient basic research.Progressive capitalism is based on a new social contract between voters and elected officials, between workers and corporations, between rich and poor, and between those with jobs and those who are un- or underemployed. Part of this new social contract is an expanded for many programs now provided by private entities or not at allIt was a mistake not to include the public option in Obamacare: It would have enriched choice and enhanced competition, lowering prices. But one can design public options in other arenas as well, for instance for retirement and mortgages. This new social contract will enable most Americans to once again have a middle-class life.As an economist, I am always asked: Can we afford to provide this middle-class life for most, let alone all, Americans? Somehow, we did when we were a much poorer country in the years after World War II. In our politics, in our labor-market participation, and in our health we are already paying the price for our failures.The neoliberal fantasy that unfettered markets will deliver prosperity to everyone should be put to rest. It is as fatally flawed as the notion after the fall of the Iron Curtain that we were seeing \"the end of history\" and that we would all soon be liberal democracies with capitalist economies.Most important, our exploitive capitalism has shaped who we are as individuals and as a society. The rampant dishonesty we've seen from Wells Fargo and Volkswagen or from members of the Sackler family as they promoted drugs they knew were addictive -- this is what is to be expected in a society that lauds the pursuit of profits as leading, to quote Adam Smith, \"as if by an invisible hand,\" to the well-being of society, with no regard to whether those profits derive from exploitation or wealth creation.Joseph E.

It was a broadcast of an hourlong \"Firing Line\" interview in 1980 between William F. Buckley Jr. and Malcolm Muggeridge, the British journalist who late in life converted to Christianity.In the course of the interview, Mr. Muggeridge used a parable. Imagine that the Apostle Paul, after his Damascus Road conversion, starts off on his journey, Mr. Muggeridge said, and consults with an eminent public relations man. \"I've got this campaign and I want to promote this gospel,\" Paul tells this individual, who responds, \"Well, you've got to have some sort of symbol.\" To which Paul would reply: \"Well, I have got one. I've got this cross.\"\"The public relations man would have laughed his head off,\" Mr. Muggeridge said, with the P.R. man insisting: \"You can't popularize a thing like that. It's absolutely mad.\"The reaction of Mr. Muggeridge's imaginary P.R. person is understandable. The Episcopal priest Fleming Rutledge has written that until the accounts of Jesus' death burst upon the Mediterranean world, \"no one in the history of human imagination had conceived of such a thing as the worship of a crucified man.\" And yet the crucifixion -- an emblem of agony and one of the cruelest methods of execution ever practiced -- became a historical pivot point and eventually the most compelling symbol of the most popular faith on earth.As a non-Christian friend of mine put it to me recently, the idea that people would worship a God who is compassionate toward us is one thing, but to worship a God who suffers and dies -- as a condemned criminal, no less -- is distinct to Christianity. In my friend's understated words, \"When you think about it, it is a little strange.\"Perhaps the aspect of the crucifixion that is easiest to understand is that according to Christian theology, atonement is the means through which human beings -- broken, fallen, sinful -- are reconciled to God. The ideal needed to be sacrificed for the non-ideal, the worthy for the unworthy.But the cross is more than simply a gateway to the City of God. \"I could never myself believe in God, if it were not for the cross,\" John Stott, one of the most important Christian evangelists of the last century, wrote in \"The Cross of Christ.\" \"The only God I believe in is the One Nietzsche ridiculed as 'God on the cross.' In the real world of pain, how could one worship a God who was immune to it?\" From the perspective of Christianity, one can question why God allows suffering, but one cannot say God doesn't understand it. He is not remote, indifferent, untouched or unscarred.Scott Dudley, the senior pastor at Bellevue Presbyterian Church in Bellevue, Wash., and a lifelong friend, pointed out to me that on the cross God was reconciling the world to himself -- but God was also, perhaps, reconciling himself to the world. The cross is not only God's way of saying we are not alone in our suffering, but also that God has entered into our suffering through his own suffering.Scott readily concedes that there's no good answer to the question, \"Why is there suffering?\" Jesus never answers that question, and even if we had the theological answer, it would not ease our burdens in any significant way. What God offers instead is the promise that he is with us in our suffering; that he can bring good out of it (life out of death, forgiveness out of sin); and that one day he will put a stop to it and redeem it. God, Revelation tells us, will make \"all things new.\" For now, though, we are part of a drama unfolding in a broken world, one in which God chose to become a protagonist.One other significant consequence the crucifixion had was to \"introduce a new plot to history: The victim became a hero by offering himself as a willing victim,\" in the words of the Christian author Philip Yancey. Citing the works of the French philosopher Rene Girard and Mr. Girard's student Gil Bailie, Mr. Yancey argues that a radiating effect of the cross was to undermine abusive power and injustice; that care for the disenfranchised and those living in the shadows of society came about as a direct result of Jesus' crucifixion.Edward Shillito, a minister in England who watched waves of badly wounded soldiers return from World War I, wrote a poem, \"Jesus of the Scars,\" in which he said, \"The heavens frighten us; they are too calm; In all the universe we have no place. Our wounds are hurting us; where is the balm? Lord Jesus, by thy scars we know thy grace.\" Mr. Shillito ended his poem with this stanza, which beautifully captures what makes the cross unique:The other gods were strong; but thou wast weak;They rode, but thou didst stumble to a throne;But to our wounds only God's wounds can speak,And not a god has wounds, but thou alone.Worshiping a God of wounds is a little strange, as my friend said. For some, it is grotesque and contemptible, a bizarre myth, an offense. But for others of us, what happened to Jesus on the cross is profoundly moving and life-altering -- not just a historical inflection point, but something that won and keeps winning our hearts. As individuals with wounds, flawed and fallen, we cannot help but return to the foot of the cross.The most important moment in my faith pilgrimage was when the cross became my interpretive prism. What I mean by this is that I was and remain a person with a skeptical mind and countless questions. There are parts of the Bible I still find puzzling, difficult and troubling. (That is true of many more Christians than you might imagine, and of many more Christians than are willing to admit.)But I did arrive at a settled belief that whatever the answer to those questions were -- answers I'm unlikely to ever discover -- I would understand them in the context of the cross, where God showed his enduring love for people in every circumstance and in every season of life. I came to treasure a line from an 18th-century hymn by Isaac Watts that I have replayed in my mind more often than I can count: \"Did e're such love and sorrow meet, Or thorns compose so rich a crown?\"In response to his fictional P.R. person's claim that using the cross as a symbol for faith would be mad, Malcolm Muggeridge replied: \"But it wasn't mad. It worked for centuries and centuries, bringing out all the creativity in people, all the love and disinterestedness in people, this symbol of suffering. And I think that's the heart of the thing.\"It is the heart of the thing. Where some see the cross as superstitious foolery or a stumbling block, others see grace and sublime love. For us, the glory and joy of Easter Sunday is only made possible by the anguish of Good Friday.Peter Wehner () a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, served in the previous three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer, as well as the author of the forthcoming book, \": How to Heal Our Frayed Republic After Trump.\" "},
{"appears_ulr": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/opinion/mueller-report-barr-trump-russian-disinformation.html", "title": "How Barr and Trump Use a Russian Disinformation Tactic ", "authors": "", "contents": "On Nov. 9, 2016, according to the Mueller report, some redacted figure wrote to a Russian regime crony, \"Putin has won.\" Based on the assessment of the intelligence community and the findings of Robert Mueller, President Vladimir Putin of Russia did indeed succeed in his efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Donald Trump.But Mr. Putin's ultimate victory may have come on Thursday morning, during Attorney General Bill Barr's news conference. By seamlessly conflating the terms \"collusion\" and \"conspiracy,\" and absolving President Trump of both, Mr. Barr revealed that the Russian information warfare technique of \"reflexive control\" has officially entered American public discourse -- and threatens, with his recent allegations of campaign \"spying,\" to stay there for a while.Reflexive control is a technique of psychological manipulation through disinformation. The idea is to feed your adversary a set of assumptions that will produce a predictable response: That response, in turn, furthers a goal that advances your interests. By luring your opponent into agreeing with your initial assumptions, you can control the narrative, and ultimate outcome, in your favor. Best of all, the outcome is one in which your adversary has voluntarily acceded. This is exactly what has happened with much of the American public in the course of Mueller's investigation.The assumptions that culminated in Mr. Barr's conclusions began almost two years ago, when the White House, Trump supporters and the media characterized the focus of the special counsel's investigation as \"collusion.\" The word \"collusion\" does not appear anywhere in Mr. : His mandate was to investigate any \"links and/or coordination\" between the Trump campaign and Russia. There is a good reason for this: \"Collusion\" is the legal equivalent of Jell-O. Outside of specific factual contexts -- such as price fixing in antitrust law -- the word \"collusion\" has no legal meaning or significance. In fact, in his report, Mr. Mueller explicitly stated that his conclusions were not about collusion, \"which is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States code.\"The Trump administration seized on this legal ambiguity early on, with the refrain that \"collusion is not a crime.\" The standard set here is that anything falling below criminally chargeable behavior is acceptable. When it comes to the presidency, this is not true. The Constitution lays out the procedure for removing an unfit president from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"Nevertheless, we took the bait: Collusion may not be a crime, lawyers and pundits responded, but conspiracy is. This \"reflexive\" response adopted criminality as the bar to be met.But as we found in the report, conspiracy is very narrowly defined: It requires proof of an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and an \"overt act\" in furtherance of that agreement. Unlike collusion, moreover, conspiracy requires that a party have a specific state of mind -- knowledge -- of the criminal nature of his or her actions. As a former F.B.I. special agent who conducted counterintelligence investigations, I can attest that foreign intelligence services do not operate on the basis of explicit agreements or even actions that, standing alone, constitute criminal activity.Foreign intelligence services rely on manipulating vulnerabilities over time -- like greed, or fear of exposure of a secret -- to puppeteer those under their influence into acting in their interests without saying a word. Our adversaries also want to make sure they have plausible deniability, so it would be impossible to uncover an agreement made directly with a foreign government itself: As detailed in Mr. Mueller's report, most of Russia's overtures were made through cutouts and intermediaries, seeking to capitalize on the ambition of members of the Trump campaign to push along their efforts. Counterintelligence is, in effect, chasing ghosts, which is why the tools used to investigate foreign intelligence activity are secret, like human sources or electronic surveillance. It is not the stuff of which criminal prosecutions are made, and it is partly for this reason that operatives rarely see the inside of a courtroom.Nevertheless, we reached an informal agreement with the White House over the last two years: The test of Mr. Trump's fitness for office rested on Mr. Mueller's findings that the president committed a crime, namely, conspiracy with the Russian government to influence the election.Mr. Barr took advantage of this bargain, using \"collusion\" interchangeably with \"conspiracy.\" The Mueller report contains hundreds of pages detailing collusion -- behaviors that include encouraging, facilitating and being receptive to efforts by Russia and its partners, like WikiLeaks, to influence the election -- but the attorney general concluded that there was \"no underlying collusion with Russia.\" This was based on his conclusion that Mr. Mueller did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy. In short, \"collusion\" is now the same as \"conspiracy,\" and without proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the latter, the former doesn't exist.We should take a lesson from this current moment, because it is not over. Mr. Barr's latest accusations of the F.B.I. \"spying\" on the Trump campaign once again threatens to flip our understanding of words upside down. By obscuring the important role of checks and balances -- including the role of the judiciary in approving legal electronic surveillance based on probable cause -- Mr. Barr seeks to make the actions of the investigators, rather than the compromising behavior of the members of the Trump campaign they were investigating, the focus of debate. Undermining the integrity of law enforcement is a double boon for Russia, which seeks to erode Americans' confidence in our institutions and constrain our ability to stop their efforts. This time, however, we can stop our reflexive actions to Mr. Barr's linguistic sleight of hand and keep the focus on the national security threat posed by Mr. Trump's relationship with Russia. If we don't, Mr. Putin has certainly won.Asha Rangappa (@AshaRangappa), a senior lecturer at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale, was an F.B.I. special agent focusing on counterintelligence investigations.

But one conclusion is categorical: \"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.\"That may sound like old news. The Justice Department's and three companies in February 2018 laid bare much of the sophisticated Russian campaign to blacken the American democratic process and support the Trump campaign, including the theft of American identities and creation of phony political organizations to fan division on immigration, religion or race. The and a host of other dirty tricks have likewise been exhaustively chronicled.But Russia's interference in the campaign was the core issue that Mr. Mueller was appointed to investigate, and if he stopped short of accusing the Trump campaign of overtly cooperating with the Russians -- the report mercifully rejects speaking of \"collusion,\" a term that has no meaning in American law -- he was unequivocal on Russia's culpability: \"First, the Office determined that Russia's two principal interference operations in the 2016 U.S. presidential election -- the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations -- violated U.S. criminal law.\", which describes these crimes, is worthy of a close read. Despite a thick patchwork of redactions, it details serious and dangerous actions against the United States that Mr. Trump, for all his endless tweeting and grousing about the special counsel's investigation, has never overtly confronted, acknowledged, condemned or comprehended. Culpable or not, he must be made to understand that a foreign power that interferes in American elections is, in fact, trying to distort American foreign policy and national security.The earliest interference described in the report was a social media campaign intended to fan social rifts in the United States, carried out by an outfit funded by an oligarch known as \"Putin's chef\" for the feasts he catered. Called the , the unit actually sent agents to the United States to gather information at one point. What the unit called \"information warfare\" evolved by 2016 into an operation targeted at favoring Mr. Trump and disparaging Mrs. Clinton. This included posing as American people or grass-roots organizations such as the Tea Party, anti-immigration groups, Black Lives Matter and others to buy political ads or organize political rallies.At the same time, the report said, the of the Russian army's intelligence service opened another front, hacking the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and releasing reams of damaging materials through the front groups DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, and later through WikiLeaks. The releases were carefully timed for impact -- emails stolen from the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, for example, were released less than an hour after the damaging to Mr. Trump came out.All this activity, the report said, was accompanied by the well documented efforts to contact the Trump campaign through business connections, offers of assistance to the campaign, invitations for Mr. Trump to meet Mr. Putin and plans for improved American-Russian relations. Both sides saw potential gains, the report said -- Russia in a Trump presidency, the campaign from the stolen information. The Times documented between Mr. Trump and his associates and Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries. But the Mueller investigation \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"That is the part Mr. Trump sees as vindication, though the activities of his chaotic campaign team that the report describes are -- at best -- naive. It is obviously difficult for this president to acknowledge that he was aided in his election by Russia, and there is no way to gauge with any certainty .But the real danger that the Mueller report reveals is not of a president who knowingly or unknowingly let a hostile power do dirty tricks on his behalf, but of a president who refuses to see that he has been used to Since the publication of the report, Vladimir Putin and his government have been crowing that they, too, are now joining the White House in creating the illusion that the investigation was all about \"collusion\" rather than a condemnation of criminal Russian actions. was to restore relations between the United States and Russia, and to ease sanctions, the Russians certainly failed, especially given the added sanctions ordered by Congress over Moscow's interference.But if the main intent was to intensify the rifts in American society, Russia backed a winner in Mr. Trump.A perceived victory for Russian interference poses a serious danger to the United States. Already, several American agencies are working, in partnership with the tech industry, to prevent election interference going forward. But the Kremlin is not the only hostile government mucking around in America's cyberspace -- and are two others honing their cyber-arsenals, and they, too, could be tempted to manipulate partisan strife for their ends.That is something neither Republicans nor Democrats should allow. The two parties may not agree on Mr. Trump's culpability, but they have already found a measure of common ground with the sanctions they have imposed on Russia over its interference in the campaign. Now they could justify the considerable time and expense of the special counsel investigation, and at the same time demonstrate that the fissure in American politics is not terminal, by jointly making clear to Russia and other hostile forces that the democratic process, in the United States and its allies, is strictly off limits to foreign clandestine manipulation, and that anyone who tries will pay a heavy price."},

He went on to denounce the \"Report\" -- scare quotes in the original -- for containing statements that \"are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad).\"So the Mueller report is now, in the official White House version, \"total exoneration,\" except when it's \"total bullshit.\" Got that?In June 2017, The Wall Street Journal editorial board, long a skeptic of Mueller's probe, offered the central argument for why an investigation was necessary. \"Russian meddling in U.S. elections is a serious matter and Americans need to know what happened,\" . \"If Mr. Trump or key associates canoodled with the Russians to steal an election, then he must face the likely consequence of impeachment.\"That's exactly right. And it's why an investigation by a partisan-controlled House or Senate committee would never have sufficed, either for the purposes of establishing the facts or affording the president the vindication he now claims. Would, say, the \"Nunes Report\" have convinced anyone who wasn't already planning to vote for Trump that no collusion had taken place? Would a decision by the president to fire Mueller in 2017 -- as he very nearly did -- have allayed suspicions, much less put the matter behind us?Only Mueller, with his reputation for probity and credibility among Democrats, could have prevented the collusion narrative from achieving the status of unshakable faith among millions of Americans, akin to the false \"Bush lied, people died\" narrative that still dogs the 43rd president. That required the no-stone-left-unturned approach manifest in the long investigation and 448-page report. Anything else would have been dismissed as a whitewash.So why aren't conservatives grateful?From the beginning of the investigation, conservatives have been invested in a counter-narrative that is as flawed as the collusion narrative itself. This has various elements, from to cast doubt on Russian interference, to the investigation had its genesis in Christopher Steele's salacious dossier, to the that there can be no obstruction of justice without an underlying crime -- a point that ought to be obvious to anyone who supported impeaching Bill Clinton for lying under oath about a non-criminal act.Most absurd: The claim, repeated Thursday by Attorney General William Barr, that the White House fully cooperated with the investigation. For more on that, of the report where then-White House counsel Don McGahn opted to quit instead of participating in the firing of Mueller.\"He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his office, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told [Reince] Priebus that the President had asked him to 'do crazy shit,' and informed Priebus and [Steve] Bannon that he was leaving.\"Here's what conservatives have largely failed to acknowledge: Trump's absolution by Mueller didn't come about because his intentions were innocent, but because his aims were thwarted or his methods were incompetent.If his own staff hadn't blocked him from firing Mueller, he would have done so. If Don Jr. had been delivered a crate full of stolen Clinton documents at that Trump Tower meeting with a shady Russian lawyer, he would have taken it. If this newspaper hadn't exposed Paul Manafort for taking illicit cash from Ukraine's president, he might well have wound up as a senior U.S. official vulnerable to Russian blackmail. If the Senate hadn't blocked Trump from , or public opinion hadn't revolted over his performance at Helsinki, he would have cozied up to Vladimir Putin.Trump is the guy who keeps getting saved from walking into oncoming traffic, only to complain that someone yanked his collar. This makes Mueller the latest in a long list of figures whose scrupulousness saved Trump from the consequences of his unscrupulousness. For this,the special counsel will get no thanks from the president, much less an apology from all the two-bit talking heads who spent the past 23 months questioning his motives and impugning his integrity.The good news in all this is that the rule of law and reason still function in the Age of Trump -- despite Trump. Responsible officials checked a dangerous president. Political pressure allowed Mueller to finish his report and ensured its release. Americans got a comprehensive presentation and analysis of the facts, which may have exonerated the president legally but which clearly indict him morally. Ultimately the matter will be settled at the polls in November 2020.The system, as they say, worked. Conservatives who claim to believe in that system should be grateful they didn't get their wish when they sought to tear it down."},

Wish fulfillment is all it was, though. It's a national disgrace that Trump sleeps in the White House instead of a federal prison cell, but it has been a while since I had any expectation that the special counsel Robert Mueller's findings, many of which were finally released to the public on Thursday, could set things right. Instead, I'd desperately hoped for something more modest: clarity. A rough public consensus on what happened in the 2016 election and its aftermath, akin to the Warren Commission report on the assassination of President John Kennedy, or the 9/11 Commission Report. A set of facts that serious people could agree on, leaving conspiracy theories at least somewhat marginalized.There are a lot of reasons Trump's election remains a festering wound. It was a horrifying shock to many of us and, given his decisive loss in the popular vote, an insult to democracy. But there was also so much destabilizing weirdness surrounding it. Trump's relationship with President Vladimir Putin of Russia has long been suspect; as Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who was the House majority leader at the time, told colleagues in a , \"There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.\" (He was speaking of Dana Rohrabacher, the slavishly pro-Putin former Republican congressman.)Several weeks before Trump was inaugurated, America's intelligence agencies reported that Russia had engaged in cyberoperations to help him win. In the months that followed, there was one staggering revelation after another about secret conversations between Trump's circle and various figures linked to Russian intelligence.At the same time, the new administration unleashed on the public a degrading cacophony of lies, of the sort many of us associate with authoritarian countries like Russia. The day after the new president was sworn in, Sean Spicer, Trump's first press secretary, stood in the White House briefing room and insisted that the inauguration crowd had been unprecedented in size. This was terrifying, despite the petty stupidity of the untruth, because Americans were not yet used to being told to believe government diktats over the clear evidence of their senses.This quickly became our new normal. Once Republicans realized the power they could amass by collaborating in Trumpian mendacity, most of them gleefully abandoned any sense of epistemological solidarity with their fellow Americans. There's a reason \"\" has become one of the most overused terms of the Trump era. And perhaps the biggest lie of all was that Mueller's investigation, rather than the events that precipitated it, was the real scandal, an attempt to frame Trump rather than an effort to get to the bottom of an assault on our democracy.It was probably naive to think that Mueller could cut through such a thick web of falsity. But if anyone could have, it would have been him, the embodiment of a set of old-fashioned virtues that still ostensibly command bipartisan respect. Over the months of the investigation, he came to represent for many an ideal of manliness that rebuked Trump's insecure machismo. He was a war hero, Trump was a shirker. He was a public servant, Trump a venal con man. He was honest, Trump a liar. America doesn't have a Walter Cronkite anymore, a person whose word is trusted implicitly across the political spectrum. Mueller was as close as we were going to get.He and his team have now given us the clearest picture yet of the murky events surrounding Trump's ascension. \"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion,\" . The Trump campaign welcomed this interference, but, we now know, did not assist in it. \"Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" Once in office, Trump sought to thwart the investigation into what Russia had done. He believed -- correctly, as it happens -- that Russia's actions cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory. The report says he may also have feared that what appears to be his advance notice of the WikiLeaks dumps of hacked Democratic emails and his campaign's now infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian emissaries offering dirt on Hillary Clinton \"could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.\" Further, although \"the President publicly stated during and after the election that he had no connection to Russia,\" his company was negotiating to build a Trump Tower Moscow throughout most of the campaign, a fact that could have hurt him politically if it got out.Numerous commentators have said that the report reads like a road map, and in a remotely functional country that's what it would be. Mueller makes it clear that because of the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, \"we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.\" Instead, the evidence is laid out for congressional action, or even for prosecutors to indict after Trump leaves office.The test for us now is how much evidence still matters. Before the report came out, William Barr, Trump's attorney general, created a fog of disinformation around it, blatantly misleading the public about what it contained.Weeks before anyone else could read the report, he tried to close the door on obstruction, implying falsely that Mueller meant to leave the decision to him. In a news conference on Thursday, Barr repeatedly said that Mueller had found no \"collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller, however, never examined the case through the lens of \"collusion,\" which isn't a term in criminal law: \"In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of 'collusion,'\" the report says. Barr claimed that \"evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.\" The report is overstuffed with evidence of corrupt motives.But most people aren't going to read the nearly 500-page report. Republicans have already seized on Barr's words -- and on the lack of criminal charges in a document that was never going to contain criminal charges -- to claim total vindication for Trump. The president's manifest disloyalty to the country in trying to halt an investigation into a foreign attack on an American election is, to the right, of no account. Nor are the counterintelligence implications of Mueller's findings, which aren't part of the report. In the eyes of the president's supporters, his campaign did not participate in the criminal conspiracy that helped elect him, so no more needs to be said.The reaction to the report shows that between the minority of Americans who support Trump and the majority who do not, there may no longer be even the possibility of a shared sense of reality or national purpose. Even as exemplary a figure as Mueller cannot change that.Compounding the problem, Republicans are willing to act unilaterally on their perception of reality, but Democrats are not. As Hannah Arendt wrote in 1951, \"Totalitarianism will not be satisfied to assert, in the face of contrary facts, that unemployment does not exist; it will abolish unemployment benefits as part of its propaganda.\" The same logic underlies Republican threats to actualize fantasies about an attempted deep-state coup by opening an investigation into the Mueller investigation's origins.Most Democrats, conversely, have facts on their side, but not conviction. They are reluctant to begin an impeachment inquiry into Trump because majorities, in polls, don't support it, and there is no Republican buy-in. Whether or not this is politically wise, failing to impeach would be a grave abdication. If you want people to believe that the misdeeds enumerated in the Mueller report are serious, you have to act like it. To not even try to impeach Trump is to collaborate in the Trumpian fiction that he has done nothing impeachable. On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren took the lead among Democratic presidential candidates in to begin. Others should follow her. Mueller has given us the truth of what Trump has done, and in that sense the hokey faith the Resistance put in him was not misplaced. But right now only a political fight can make that truth matter."}
